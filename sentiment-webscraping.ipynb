      "[<p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Facebook's proposed new cryptocurrency, Libra—the subject of hearings just now in Washington—is designed like a classic currency from the colonial period of history. Anyone presenting a unit of specified foreign exchange will get a proportional unit of Libra. For example, one dollar might get one Libra, one euro 1.1 Libras, 66 Indian rupees one Libra, and so on, based on the price Libra advertises in various global currencies. In the archetypical monetary arrangement of the colonial period, in the hundred years prior to the second World War, colonial currencies were available at a set rate to anyone presenting the British pound sterling.</p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">These two are emulating the major elements of the monetary system of yore, as if we need it again. Photocredit: Getty</p>, <p>This practice came to be known as a \"currency board.\" It fits the Libra proposal to a T. The idea under colonialism was that an independent local currency might not have very wide purchase, even in its own area. It might be overprinted, unrecognizable to many economic agents, and preferred less than more major currencies. The way to guarantee the local currency was to make handing over the pound (or in places, the dollar, the French franc, or gold) the only way of getting it. The currency board accepted the pound in exchange for the local currency unit, and vice versa. Internally, that unit was accepted as the pound would be. Externally, one returned the local unit to the currency board and got the globally accepted pound, on demand and automatically.</p>, <p>It was precisely the high degree of \"automaticity\" of the currency boards that won over the public. Under a currency board, a local currency was automatically equivalent to the dominant global currency, the pound. Furthermore, no central bank at the local currency level was called for. All monetary production proceeded from the presentation of foreign exchange at the currency board.</p>, <p>The main effect came in terms of investment. Investors piled into currency-board areas on the understanding that returns would come in the world's top currency. The economic results were increases in opportunities and prosperity.</p>, <p>There was a devil in the details. A currency board necessarily collected a large amount of pound sterling. A pile of the best currency has its temptations—namely for the local potentate to abscond with it, whatever the effects on the local issue from that point forward. With every success of a currency board came a greater temptation to abrogate the whole thing and pocket the foreign exchange.</p>, <p>The colonial context was, therefore, essential to the functioning of currency boards. If ever a local currency board made off with British pounds, Britain itself could mete out punishments. These might include applying British law to the offending party, denying the convertibility of local notes, freezing out the area from imperial trade preferences, and pressing British power and prerogatives at the expense of local authorities. Such potential sanctions were enough to keep the currency-board reserves intact and untouched. Indeed, they were often held in Britain itself. This drove the point home: no touching these things.</p>, <p>Modern currency boards, those that persisted or arose after 1945, lacked the oversight that faded with decolonization. The guarantees of the high-quality foreign-exchange stashes of currency boards had to come, if at all, in different forms.</p>, <p>The most successful modern currency-board area is Hong Kong, which has maintained a U.S. dollar currency board for decades. Hong Kong has a fantastic incentive not to raid its dollar stash. Hong Kong is one of the very richest and freest places in the world and a shining example of what its immense neighbor China might aspire to be. Raiding its currency-board reserves would amount to self-mutilation on heroic scale.</p>, <p>Other examples, though, follow a different course. Argentina has operated with a dollar-based currency board. After periods of success, though, the temptation has proven too great for certain challenged Argentine leaders not to liquidate the reserves. Inevitably the reserve raids fund vote-buying schemes suggestive of Juan Perón's diminution of the country's immense gold stock of the World War II era for just that purpose.</p>, <p>Argentina is not part of a colonial structure, because such things now belong to the ages, so it nominally gets away with this sort of behavior. The pale shadow of colonial watchfulness is the International Monetary Fund, created as it was in 1944 on the expectation of decolonization. Argentina has no problem taking on an international-organization paper tiger on the order of the IMF. The British Empire at its apogee, the IMF certainly is not.</p>, <p>Currency boards really worked under colonialism. In modern times, they work according to the widely varying local levels of determination that they work. Facebook's Libra consortium aspires to be a currency board accepting all sorts of high-level foreign exchange. The requirements and problems that come with currency boards are still there in this case.</p>, <p>Obviously, there is no imperial structure mandating that the Libra currency board work. This is no small matter, given that this was the secret to the superior functioning of currency boards during their high season. Conceivably there is a substitute in the rule of law. Libra is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and promises to warehouse its reserves across important places in the developed world. This confers a strong sense that any attempt to make off with reserves, on the part of the Libra partnership, would face the brunt of the developed world's contract and larceny laws.</p>, <p>Yet if Libra succeeds, its owners should be paid, and perhaps getting paid will be misconstrued as larceny. If Libra really succeeds, its reserves will be phenomenally large, perhaps much larger than any other corporate or personal fortune ever seen. There is no extant legal structure, even in the leading members of the advanced world, that has had to deal with that kind of scale of monetary ownership. Governments might get jealous; they are supposed to be the ones, they tell themselves, with the final claim on financial resources.</p>, <p>This knotty problem might be seen as introducing the reverse of the classical currency board problem. The major nations might want to get their hands on the Libra reserve. Central banks are prepared to act along these lines as a matter of course. If, say, Libra were required to keep a fraction of its reserves with the Federal Reserve—and the current hearings are giving this impression—by that institution's authority it could up reserve requirements tantamount to confiscating Libra's holdings.</p>, <p>This would represent a warping of the colonial precedent. Here major countries would prevent peripheral organizations from taking advantage of the global acceptability of their currencies. Colonial currency boards sought to do the opposite, to guarantee peripheral issues by making them equivalents of things like the pound and the dollar. Libra runs a clear risk of having the sovereigns of its reserve-asset issues raid those issues. In the face of such a prospect, we could do with a dash of colonialism again, of noblesse oblige, of letting people do good things with the dollar, the euro, etc. if they are able.</p>, <p>Libra amounts to a major-currency exchange-traded fund. Like Bitcoin before it, which emulates gold, Libra is emulating currency boards. It is uncanny how the paradigmatic industries of the twenty-first century in technology and computer science are marking out the nature of the currency systems of the past, against official bewilderment that there is any need for such a thing.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c25=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I&amp;#8217;m a professor who&amp;#8217;s interested in our economic history and the theory that went into making it &amp;#8211; for good or ill.

      "[<p>*******************************************</p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">July 15, 2019</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sen. Mike Crapo, Chairman</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ranking Member</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">United States Senate</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs</span></p>, <p>July 16, 2019 Hearing</p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dear Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown: </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I appreciate the opportunity to submit the following statement for your consideration, and would like to thank you and the members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. My background spans both the traditional financial system and digital assets, as I spent 22 years on Wall Street (most recently as managing director and head of Morgan Stanley’s pension solutions business in New York until 2016) and have been involved with digital assets for nearly 7 years. Presently, I serve on the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force as a gubernatorial appointee and am co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, which is continuing to build a welcoming framework for the digital asset industry’s regulatory compliance. I am purely a volunteer in both roles. This testimony is my own and should not be construed to represent the views of either organization. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Libra project is shining light on outdated U.S. financial regulations that are (a) holding back the U.S. economy and (b) giving rise to the concept of digital currency “stablecoins” in the first place. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital currencies are the first major innovation in payment systems in nearly five decades. It is imperative that the U.S. tread carefully on this matter, since the genie is out of the bottle—digital currencies cannot be uninvented, and they offer significantly more efficient payment systems relative to those of the status quo. If we fight this technological trend, the innovation will simply move offshore rather than die. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Below I expand on these four main points: (1) how outdated financial regulations caused the creation of stablecoins, which brought us to this juncture; (2) that digital currencies are the first major innovation in the payment system in decades; (3) that a model for how to fix U.S. federal regulations exists, and it can be found in Wyoming’s new blockchain laws; and (4) that Congress should be concerned about two particular issues pertaining to Facebook’s project: privacy and Federal Reserve interest payments. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Banks have largely shunned the digital currency industry, making it difficult (if not impossible) for investors to trade U.S. dollars and digital currencies back and forth. If they could, investors would use the traditional banking system to do this, just as they do when trading stocks or commodities back and forth with dollars, but the traditional banking system has almost entirely blocked them. So, out of necessity the digital currency industry responded by inventing a “stablecoin”—a digital currency backed by dollars held in trust, whose trades settle on payment rails that are far more efficient than those of the traditional banking system, but which is also inextricably linked to the traditional banking system.  </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, if Congress wants to make stablecoins irrelevant (including Libra), it can easily do so—simply by allowing the banking system to consistently bank this new asset class.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To address the conditions that gave rise to stablecoins in the first place, Congress should:</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many banks have tried to fix the slumbering payment system and some are attempting to create their own blockchain-based alternative systems, but regulatory barriers have slowed the progress of these projects to a crawl comparatively. One such example is “Fnality,” formerly known as “Utility Settlement Coin,” which is making progress but is already nearly four years old.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How does Facebook Libra fit into this? </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The basic building blocks of Facebook’s project are not new, with only one exception. The project is functionally akin to a money market fund (the Libra Association) plus a payment network (Calibra wallet), except that its transactions settle on a new type of payment system. The money market fund (Libra Association) invests in a basket of global currencies, government bonds and bank deposits. The payment network (Calibra wallet) is akin to a global version of PayPal or Venmo. The only difference, again, is that transactions in Libra settle on a new type of payment system—one that is far more efficient than any status quo payment system. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It should surprise no one that there’s demand for a more efficient payment system. Already, the U.S. has lost the Libra Association to Switzerland, which has a more welcoming regulatory regime for blockchain projects than the U.S. This, too, should surprise no one.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Within the past two years, Wyoming has developed a world-class regulatory framework for digital currencies like Libra and other digital assets, with the help of some of America’s top law firms and law professors. Here’s what Wyoming has done:</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Bank of England’s move to expand its interest-bearing deposit program to Facebook (and other tech companies) illustrates that the U.S. must tread carefully, as other countries will be courting Facebook to redomicile if U.S. regulation is too heavy-handed. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To summarize, the Facebook Libra project is aimed at satisfying demand for a much more efficient payment system relative to the status quo. Congress should recognize that the U.S. is already playing catch-up. Our bad regulations caused the invention of stablecoins in the first place, which is what brought us here today. And Facebook already chose a non-U.S. location (Switzerland) for the Libra Association, in what should be recognized as a “shot across the bow” to the U.S. Rather than fight the first real innovation in payment systems in decades, the U.S. should embrace it. Wyoming’s suite of innovative blockchain laws shows that such an embrace can be done largely within the existing regulatory regime, in a manner that provides legal certainty, protects consumers and promotes innovation. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I would be happy to answer questions as the Committee sees fit.</span></p>, <p> </p>, <p _ngcontent-c25=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I&amp;#8217;m a 22-year Wall Street veteran who has been active in bitcoin since 2012, and whose passion is a fair and stable financial system.

      "[<p class=\"color-body light-text\">Facebook is meeting resistance from Congress and regulators to its proposed Libra cryptocurrency.</p>, <p>There’s just one little problem: however cool Ethereum’s smart contracts may be, in practice a majority of smart contracts have bugs and security holes, as a study of tens of thousands of them has shown. Even worse, smart contracts are part of the “immutable ledger” that is supposed to make things secure. Except when there are bugs and security holes, it doesn’t.</p>, <p>Facebook has quietly recognized that smart contracts are needed to make the primitive blockchain database even marginally practical, but that most smart contracts aren’t even modestly intelligent. How are they going to fix this problem?</p>, <p>Facebook has followed in this clear pattern. They actually spell out, in no uncertain terms, that existing smart contract implementations are dangerous things, riddled with bugs and filled with security holes. But it’s nearly impossible to build a marginally usable cryptocurrency system of the kind Facebook wants without them.</p>, <p>Facebook is proud of its solution: a new software language called Move. Yes, a language called “Move.”</p>, <p>I’ve spent a little time checking out the new language. The developers are generally right about the deficiencies they are addressing, effectively endorsing the view that existing smart contracts are hopelessly flawed. They are smart and have put forward credible solutions to the problems. It’s just possible that, after a few years and after the software has gone open-source, the new system will turn out to be an improvement on the old one. But before deciding that, let’s do something programmers avoid doing: take a quick look at history.</p>, <p>I’ve got a bridge.

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The reporting process</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Facebook has launched a new tool for reporting scam ads in the UK, and says it may roll it out to other countries if it works.</p>, <p>The tool was created as part of a legal settlement with British financial expert and broadcaster Martin Lewis, who runs the Moneysavingexpert.com financial advice site.</p>, <p>It allows users to report an ad they believe to be fraudulent or misleading by clicking three dots in the top right-hand corner of every ad. This, says the firm, will alert a dedicated team within the company that will examine the ad and, if appropriate, take it down.</p>, <p>Under the agreement, Facebook has also promised to give £3 million to the charity network Citizens Advice to help victims of online fraudsters specialist advice, either online, on the phone or face-to-face. As well as scam ads, the service will also help with other common scams such as antivirus and fake invoice messages; website scams like copycat sites; and investment scams that involve buying non-existent stocks, shares and other investments such as rare wine or art.</p>, <p>\"Scam ads are an industry-wide problem caused by criminals and have no place on Facebook. Through our work with Martin Lewis, we’re taking a market leading position and our new reporting tool and dedicated team are important steps to stop the misuse of our platform,\" says Steve Hatch, Facebook's vice president for Northern Europe.</p>, <p>\"Prevention is also key. Our £3 million donation to Citizens Advice will not only help those who have been impacted by scammers, but raise awareness of how to avoid scams too.\"</p>, <p>“The UK faces an epidemic of online scam ads – they’re everywhere. Yet disgracefully there’s little effective law or regulation to prevent them, and official enforcement is poor to non-existent, as these criminals are usually based outside of the EU,\" he says.</p>, <p>\"Today should be the start of real improvement. The aim is to tap the power of what I’m dubbing ‘social policing’ to fight these scams. Millions of people know a scam when they see it, and millions of others don’t. So now, I’d ask all who recognise them to use the new Facebook reporting tool, to help protect those who don’t – which includes many who are vulnerable.\"</p>, <p>For now, the tool is available only in the UK. However, a Facebook spokeswoman says the company is 'certainly not ruling out the possibility of taking something like this to other markets if it works well'.</p>, <p>There's certainly a need: just last month, the company was forced to remove a series of fake bitcoin ads featuring  the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.

      "[<p class=\"color-body light-text\">The wireless and untethered Quest, Oculus's latest hardware release.</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Outside perception of Facebook’s virtual reality efforts seem encouraging, especially hot off the release of the wireless, untethered VR HMD Oculus Quest. One of the co-founders of Oculus, however, is skeptical. In fact, Jack McCauley doesn’t think there’s a real market for VR gaming.</p>, <p>“Video games have not evolved into a 3-D experience for a number of reasons,” he continued. “I don’t know what kind of application it would be for VR that would keep players plugged in for six hours like they do with game consoles.”</p>, <p>Many people have different ideas of what success means within virtual reality. With so many standards yet to be nailed down, no one’s specific take stands above the rest and the industry continues to innovate and iterate. McCauley, however, was a founder for one of the pivotal VR headsets and some would think that role made him an informed evangelist or even biased toward the technology but it seems he was skeptical from the beginning.</p>, <p>“You put it on, and there’s a lot of ‘Wow!’ to it, but then what do you do with it?” McCauley said. “Even when I was there I thought people weren’t going to wear a headset and walk around with it in public.”</p>, <p>Keep in mind that McCauley seems to only be speaking on virtual reality as it pertains to the gaming industry. VR itself is being used across a plethora of industries, including vehicle engineering and medical training, so the technology itself will likely persist. There’s always a chance that the steady growth of VR gaming could taper off and he seems confident that will be the outcome.</p>, <p>“I may be wrong, but I’ve been doing this a long time,” he said. “I’ve already done a lot of what people do mistake-wise. You have your gut, and it tells you if you’re right or wrong. And in this case I think I’m right.”</p>]\n",

      "[<p class=\"color-body light-text\">The head of Facebook’s cryptocurrency subsidiary Calibra, David Marcus, testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. </p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Facebook says it’s willing to work with U.S. regulators prior to offering its budding cryptocurrency Libra to the public, a concession that seemed designed to appease a bipartisan group of lawmakers who fear adoption by the company’s 2.38 billion registered users could undermine the stability of the global financial system and give Facebook access to too much personal financial information.</p>, <p>He defended the cryptocurrency by emphasizing that in order to use Facebook’s Calibra digital wallet you would need to create a new account and use a government-issued ID to confirm your identity. He said Facebook believes this form of authentication will deter criminals from using the currency for nefarious purposes.</p>, <p>“The way that we think about protecting the integrity of the network against money laundering, criminal activity and terrorism funding is by moving a lot of cash transactions into the digital world. Cash transactions are where most crimes happen,” he said. “The way we are applying [anti-money-laundering] programs as far as the Calibra wallet is concerned, we will have strong identity [protections].”</p>, <p>Trump tweeted on Thursday that he is “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.“ He added, “Facebook Libra's ‘virtual currency’ will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National and International.”</p>, <p>Senators also chastised Facebook for failing to prevent misuse of consumer data in the past, included its admission last year that a political-ad-targeting firm had improperly gained access to more than 87 million users. “Facebook has demonstrated through scandal after scandal that it doesn’t deserve our trust. It should be treated like the profit-seeking corporation it is, just like any other company,” said Senator Sherrod Brown (D- Ohio).</p>, <p>He cited other privacy breaches, such as the millions of fake posts spread by a Russian propaganda firm during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Now Facebook asks people to trust them with their hard-earned paychecks. It takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance to look at that track record and think, ‘You know, really what we really ought to do next? Let’s run our own bank and our own for-profit version of the Federal Reserve. Let’s do it for the whole world.’”</p>, <p>Facebook plans to make money from Libra eventually, but the company has no immediate plans to use transaction data for advertising purposes. Answering questions about the long-term opportunity for Facebook, Marcus said, “It’s the ability for the 90 million small businesses [on Facebook] to transact with one another. And if there’s more commerce, there will be more advertising revenue for Facebook. More commercial activity on Facebook equals more money for Facebook.”</p>, <p>I'm an associate editor at Forbes covering Facebook and social media. I previously worked as an editor for Popular Science, Gizmodo, and Mashable leading investigations</p>]\n"

      "[<p class=\"color-body light-text\">David Marcus </p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Facebook wants forgiveness. And to earn that forgiveness, the social media giant that was accused of allowing its users' personal data to be used by the controversial political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica has an uncanny plan. It’s going to use cryptocurrency, which was originally popularized as a way to anonymously buy drugs, to connect people without bank accounts to the global economy. That, and it will likely have to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the alleged privacy violations.</p>, <p>The secret to this seemingly impossible task is that Facebook and the other companies in the nonprofit Libra Association have promised that every libra will be backed by stable assets, almost certainly including the U.S. dollar and government treasury bonds. While some central banks, like the Bank of England, have already reacted positively to the news their currency could be locked up in accounts held by private companies, the U.S. Federal Reserve has expressed concerns. President Donald Trump has called for the companies to get a banking charter, and multiple members of Congress have asked for a moratorium on development of the cryptocurrency until more is known.</p>, <p>“Clearly we made mistakes in the past, and it’s a top priority for Mark [Zuckerberg] and the rest the leadership team to really address this,” says Marcus, who previously served as a board member for cryptocurrency startup Coinbase. “And as far as I’m concerned I see libra as an opportunity to demonstrate that we have learned and we are a different company now than we were.”</p>, <p class=\"color-body light-text\"><small>Forbes</small></p>, <p>While Marcus’ submitted comments call such privacy a “top priority” for the Libra Association, he adds that the ultimate regulator in charge is not even in the U.S., since to the nonprofit organization's headquarters are in Geneva. “For the purposes of data and privacy protections, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) will be the Libra Association’s privacy regulator,” his notes read. </p>, <p>Regarding the project’s stance on privacy, Marcus says the Libra Association “cannot, and will not, monetize data on the blockchain,” though he is notably silent on how Calibra, the Facebook-owned wallet for buying, holding and storing cryptocurrency will use or not use customer data, saying only that “Calibra customers’ account and financial information will not be shared with Facebook” and leaving the door open for other possible uses.</p>, <p>“As a consumer, no matter which wallet you choose, you’re going to get the benefit of the scale of the network,” says Marcus. “And for that reason we really need to earn consumers’ trust if we want to have a fighting chance.” Further competition will likely come from fellow fiat-backed stablecoins like Circle’s USD Coin and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’s Gemini Dollar, which also already have live products, while MakerDao and soon-to-be launched Celo offer similar stability without fiat currency at all.</p>, <p>The second misunderstanding Marcus hopes to clarify to Congress is that critics, he says, have inaccurately portrayed libra as a weakening of central bank monetary supply controls, especially the ability to buy back government bonds as a way to increase demand for a currency. Since the Libra Association is committed to a 1:1 pairing of the value of currency, bonds and other assets stored in banks around the world with the value of the libra cryptocurrency in circulation, Marcus says monetary supply controls won’t be impacted. Should a central bank seek to buy back treasury bonds owned by the association, the association could compensate for that by purchasing other assets in different jurisdictions.</p>, <p>“The Libra Association has no ability to create more libra than there are corresponding value in reserve. There’s no way to print money,” says Marcus. “The monetary policy of the assets that are contained in the basket gets transferred as a unit of digital currency that represents the underlying asset.” </p>, <p>Marcus sounds prepared for the long haul. “We will have to not only make very strong commitments when it comes to serving our customers,\" he says. “But we will have to live up to them for a very long period of time.”</p>, <p>I report on how blockchain and cryptocurrencies are being adopted by enterprises and the broader business community.

France is imposing a new digital tax targeting Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. </p>, <p>As with all corporate taxes, there is a widespread misunderstanding as to who actually pays the tax. Since in order to stay in business, customers have to cover all of a company's costs -- including taxes -- it is customers who ultimately pay the taxes.</p>, <p>The French estimate that the new tax will yield 500 million euros a year. That may be so, but it will not reduce these companies' profits, they are merely the tax collectors.</p>, <p>This does not mean these companies will be unscathed. There will be unintended but predictable side effects.</p>, <p>Apple and Amazon will be easier to compete with within France at least until their competitors grow big enough to be subject to the tax. Still, I'd bet on Apple and Amazon even if their competitors have a 3% tax advantage.</p>, <p>No one ever bought an Apple product because it was the cheapest alternative. And, with all the shenanigans that can occur when you buy things over the internet, Amazon's A to Z Guarantee is a good reason for the French to continue to shop on Amazon even if competitors prices are slightly lower.</p>, <p>In addition, the companies that compete with Amazon and Apple may not hold their prices constant. Instead, they could raise their prices by 3%, but since they are not subject to the tax, they will just keep the money.</p>, <p>Since Google and Facebook get their revenue from selling ads, the new tax makes it that much harder for a French company to win an auction for ad space on either platform. In fact, in every case where a French company won the bidding for an ad slot, there was a second-place bidder not far behind.</p>, <p>If Google and Facebook simply refused to sell ads to French companies (so as not to trigger the tax), the second-place bidder would take the ad space at a not very much lower price. The net effect of the tax would then be to make French companies that sell products to Google and Facebook users less competitive.</p>, <p>France has every right to impose taxes on activity within its borders as it sees fit. But this is not going to work out as they expect. However, if enough people think the new tax is a huge setback for Google, Apple, Facebook, or Amazon, we might see the stocks fall enough to give investors some great entry points.</p>, <p>I am the CEO and founder of Marketocracy, Inc.,and portfolio manager at Marketocracy Capital Management, LLC.

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Marcus, head of blockchain with Facebook Inc., speaks during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, July 16, 2019. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook previously announced plans for launching a new cryptocurrency, Libra. The company didn’t, however, discuss how this new digital currency could completely change and shake up the banking and financial establishment. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg downplayed the new currency, claiming that it will be governed by a regulatory body in Switzerland and has a number of well respected participating institutions behind it. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many doubt his assertions and believe that this is a power play to further grow his company and its span of control. If the billions of people who use Facebook decided to conduct transactions with Libra, it would jeopardize the United States and other country’s currencies and financial systems. While lightly covered, having one extremely powerful company control the flow of money, U.S. currency could suffer serious repercussions. Politicians slowly awakened to this danger and demanded that Facebook executives meet with congress.  </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It seems that Democrats and Republicans alike finally agree on something—the threat Facebook's new currency will have on the country. Tuesday, Facebook found itself once again under fire from Congress. The Senate Banking Committee grilled Facebook executive David Marcus—as CEO Mark Zuckerburg smartly avoided a return trip to the woodshed—concerning the company’s plan to launch its digital currency.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The members of Congress did not look fondly on Facebook’s new initiative. Senator Sherrod Brown openly professed his displeasure and claimed that “through scandal after scandal...it doesn't deserve our trust.\" Brown said, \"We'd be crazy to give them a chance to let them experiment with people's bank accounts.\" He further added that it was \"delusional\" for customers to trust Facebook with their \"hard-earned\" money.  Other senators shared their concerns. \"I don't trust you guys,\" said Republican Senator Martha McSally. \"Instead of cleaning up your house, you are launching into a new business model,\" she complained. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marcus, who was formerly a high-ranking executive at PayPal, tried—without much success—to get Congress on his side. He promised that Facebook would not begin offering Libra until important regulatory issues are dealt with. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has affirmed that he is uncomfortable with Libra. Mnuchin stated that Libra “could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers” and it was a “national security issue.” He said, “Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity, like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human trafficking.”  </span></p>, <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....</p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you have the president, secretary of the treasury, Fed chairman, Republicans and Democrats all agreeing on something, you know they are scared—and their fear is justified. How do you stop a company that's a money-making machine, recently paid a $5 billion fine like it's a parking ticket to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, consistently ignored privacy concerns of its users, allowed the spread of Russion disinformation, accused of stifling free speech on its platform, chastised by Congress and still pushes ahead without remorse, humility or apologies? </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The crypto market will explode to the upside. Wealth for holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will soar. Jobs will be created to deal with the incredible growth. In particular, thousands of compliance, legal, risk, audit and regulatory positions will be created to watch over this new rapidly changing sector. Meanwhile, more jobs will be cut at traditional banks, as there will be a race toward moving away from them and toward FinTech-type companies. </span></p>, <p>Facebook could expand upon its currency and become one of the largest banking institutions overnight. It would be hard for giants, such as J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, to compete with a platform that has literally billions of users each day. Facebook knows every move their members make and will certainly use it to the company’s advantage. The entire business landscape could dramatically change. Those who will be part of the Libra and cryptocurrency team will enjoy money, power and opportunities. Those left out will be scrambling, figuring out what to do next with their careers.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c25=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I am a CEO, founder, and executive recruiter at one of the oldest and largest global search firms in my area of expertise, and have personally placed thousands of profes...\">I am a CEO, founder, and executive recruiter at one of the oldest and largest global search firms in my area of expertise, and have personally placed thousands of profes...</p>]\n",

Facebook Inc.’s co-founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been called to appear before a House panel as fallout continues from revelations that Cambridge Analytica had siphoned data from some 50 million Facebook users as it built a election-consulting company that boasted it could sway voters in contests all over the world. Photographer: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg</p>, <p><b>The Breakdown You Need to Know</b></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Normally we would tell you that a fine of this magnitude would really impact Facebook, unfortunately the company will barely notice. The social media giant brought in $15.1 billion in revenues in Q1 this year, leaving many investors unbothered. Facebook stock is now up 48% on the year and $5 billion is about 9% of its total revenue for 2018, which landed at $55.83 billion.</span></p>, <p><b>Social Oversights</b></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We can also look at Facebook’s lack of diversity as being part of the problem and how they ended up in this mess to begin with. The social media giant’s workforce and leadership is only 3% black and this continued lack of diversity at Facebook hinders it from identifying ways their product might harm certain customers.</span></p>, <p>When it comes to data breaches they are often more problematic for people of color living on fixed or low incomes, or from other marginalized communities. The black community is very valuable to Facebook, with 70% of adults users in this demographic being on the platform, according to Pew Research.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c25=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I am the CEO of CultureBanx covering the intersection of business, technology and innovation for minorities.

But in 2019, improvements to the Facebook integration have led to a dramatic uptick in peer-to-peer donations: more than $1.2 million and counting, an increase of more than 2,300%.</p>, <p>“Since starting the PMC in 1980, we’ve worked to be innovative and lead on fundraising trends,” said Billy Starr, PMC Founder and Executive Director. “We were a pioneer of athletic fundraising and one of the first nonprofits to implement online peer-to-peer giving in 2000, but we continue to look for new ways to raise the bar as we grow.\"</p>, <p>\"Our 100 percent pass-through rate is incredibly important to us and our community, which means each year we need to proactively reach new donors to ensure we’re able to maintain it,\" Starr added. \"As we approach our 40th ride, integrating further with Facebook was a natural progression and it has paid off in dividends – nearly 50% of the 16,000+ Facebook donors are giving to the PMC for the first time.”</p>, <p>To make it easier for people and communities to raise money on Facebook, Facebook's free tools to help people collect donations and enable supporters to fundraise for nonprofits.

When you’re looking to raise $60 million for cancer research through a single event, connections are key,” said Bill Alfano, PMC Director of Marketing and Sponsorship. “Facebook’s Fundraiser API allows our riders to reach friends, family, even acquaintances that they may not have otherwise asked for support. It allows for easy sharing across networks and exponentially increases their ability to solicit donations.”</p>, <p>Facebook itself points to PMC as a leader in its vision to increase peer-to-peer fundraising around the world.</p>, <p>“Our Fundraiser API tool is designed to make giving easy and efficient. The Pan-Mass Challenge case is a perfect example of the tool’s potential – it’s incredible to see an already thriving athletic fundraiser be taken to new heights by simply providing their community a streamlined way to raise money,” said Kendra Sinclair, Strategic Partner Manager on Facebook’s Social Impact team. “The success is remarkable – in just over one month, the PMC has not only dramatically increased its fundraising for cancer through Facebook compared to past years, but more importantly, they are reaching new donors that may not have otherwise given to the cause.”</p>, <p>According to PMC, athletic fundraisers overall experienced a 2.7% decline in donations in 2018.

Perhaps, the crisp Swiss air will inspire the various delegates — 27 companies have announced partnerships with Facebook — to firm up their nonbinding agreements. Or, maybe the scrutiny that Facebook has received, the criticism coming from governments and techies, and the doubts expressed by cryptocurrency experts will drive some companies to withdraw. As enthusiastic as I personally am about cryptocurrency and its potential to change the world for the better, the things that I have read, watched, and discussed since the Libra news broke out have left me suspicious about Facebook’s goals and methods. I know that I’m not the only one who has doubts.</p>, <p>In just 15 years of operation, Facebook has acquired over two billion users. Millions of people who don’t use the flagship product nonetheless have daily interactions with the company, which owns both WhatsApp and Instagram. Given the meteoric pace of Facebook’s rise, it is not surprising that the company’s plans tend to be ambitious and its implementations usually swift. In the case of Libra, however, Facebook may have attempted too much too quickly.</p>, <p>Libra won’t link its valuation to a preexisting “fiat” currency issued by a government, and Facebook wants its cryptocurrency to be global. Does that sound like any other cryptocurrency? If you said that it sounds just like Bitcoin, the first and still the most trusted cryptocurrency, you’d be entirely correct. Bitcoin has existed for over a decade, and even those who prefer other currencies at least acknowledge the strength of the Bitcoin community and the trustworthiness of the currency’s algorithms. Banks, corporations, and governments have been afraid of cryptocurrencies for years, and, for the majority of them, it was too late to get involved to fully capitalize on the inevitable decentralized payment adoption.

      "[<p class=\"color-body light-text\"><small>2017 VCG</small></p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">It might be time for poker players to cash in their chips after Facebook and Carnegie Mellon researchers created an artificial intelligence (AI) bot that can beat top human professionals in six-player no-limit Texas hold'em poker, the most popular form of the card game.</p>, <p>Poker has long been regarded as a \"grand challenge\" in the field of AI. The fact that the game involves hidden information—you don’t know your opponents’ cards—means that success requires bluffing and other tactics that don't apply to many other games. This has made poker resistant to AI techniques that have produced breakthroughs in other games. Researchers have been able to develop AIs that can beat one other player at no-limit Texas hold'em poker, but multiplayer has been too difficult to crack. </p>, <p>Pluribus mastered multiplayer Texas hold'em by playing against previous versions of itself. This \"self-play\" learning method means that it was not fed any data from humans and it did not observe games played by other AI systems either.    </p>, <p>\"The AI starts from scratch by playing randomly and gradually improves as it determines which actions and which probability distribution over those actions lead to better outcomes against earlier versions of its strategy,\" Brown and Sandholm write in their paper. This strategy has been used before. For example, Google DeepMind used it to crack Go and OpenAI used it to master Dota 2. </p>, <p class=\"color-body light-text\">Journalist  Cade Metz (L) and Facebook's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun (R). </p>, <p>AI researchers have been using games as a testbed for their AI agents for decades and in recent years there have been a number of breakthroughs thanks to advances in computing, better data sets, and more sophisticated AI techniques. Tech giants are investing heavily into the space in the hope that gaming breakthroughs will lead to breakthroughs in other areas such as healthcare, science, and energy. </p>, <p>\"These innovations have important implications beyond poker, because two-player zero-sum interactions (in which one player wins and one player loses) are common in recreational games, but they are very rare in real life,\" write the researchers in a blog post. \"Real-world scenarios—such as bidding in an online auction or navigating traffic—typically involve multiple actors.\"</p>, <p>Pluribus beat top-ranked professional players in both a five AIs plus one human player format and a one AI plus five professionals format. Among the professionals were Chris Ferguson, the World Series of Poker champion, and Darren Elias, an American pro who holds the record for winning the most World Poker Tour titles. </p>, <p>There was no money at stake but the researchers claim that if each chip was worth a dollar, Pluribus would have won an average of about $5 per hand and would have made about $1,000 per hour playing against five humans. </p>, <p>Pluribus is a supercharged version of another AI bot called Libratus, which beat human pros in two-player Texas hold’em games in 2017.  </p>, <p>Unlike Libratus, Pluribus contains a new online search algorithm that can evaluate its options by searching a few moves ahead, as well as faster self-play algorithms. </p>, <p>The combination of these two factors made it possible to train Pluribus using relatively little processing power and memory. The researchers say they required just $150 worth of cloud computing resources. \"This efficiency stands in stark contrast to other recent AI milestone projects, which required the equivalent of millions of dollars’ worth of computing resources to train,\" they write. </p>, <p>\"Pluribus is a very hard opponent to play against,\" said Ferguson. \"It’s really hard to pin him down on any kind of hand. He’s also very good at making thin value bets on the river and extracting value out of his good hands.\"</p>, <p>Elias added that Pluribus's main strength is its ability to use mixed strategies, which is what humans try to do. </p>, <p>\"It’s a matter of execution for humans–to do this in a perfectly random way and to do so consistently,\" he says. \"Most people just can’t. The bot wasn’t just playing against some middle of the road pros. It was playing some of the best players in the world.\"</p>, <p>While Pluribus might send a shiver down the spine of professional poker players that make a living from winning online tournaments, they don't need to worry about coming up against Pluribus in their next match. </p>, <p _ngcontent-c25=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I'm a Staff Writer covering tech in Europe.

It is not confirmed yet, but the FTC has agreed a $5bn fine for Facebook, and its involvement with the collection and analysis of approximately 84,000,000 Facebook accounts information by Cambridge Analytica. </p>, <p>There is always going to be a dispute about was it a process of illicit collection, inappropriate analysis and usage. But the elongated journey to get to this point is a bad week for corporations playing the wild, wild, west with data from their customers. Look at British Airways this week in the UK and Marriott too in the UK. $130M fine for Marriott and $230M for British Airways. $350m+ in a week, $5.5bn in total. These fines may not sound significant, but in one week it is equal to the total services exports from the US to Belgium in 2017, or the potential value of the digital signature market by 2025, or the size of the Pacemaker market in 2017. Maybe silly comparisons, but not small ones. We are one week into this and more will come as governing bodies develop an appetite to copy what happened this week. </p>, <p class=\"color-body light-text\">Network Big Data Transfer</p>, <p><strong>We cannot escape a very basic truth that our data has value. Now we need to all respect that.</strong></p>, <p>Everybody knows that we are entering an age where new things from bitcoin to the fractional and combined values of your data (physical and digital) must have some value because Google and Facebook make a pile of money from mining it and putting it all together for advertisers. Take the data away and what do these and other media brands have assets? </p>, <p>So, what is going wrong to take for us to get this, right? There is a deep lack of understanding about what data is. It is, in effect, a currency, a two-day promise from user to company and from company to user about respecting what the exchange of it means. </p>, <p><strong>Even in 1086, users understood the interchange value of data. William, the Conqueror, got it.</strong></p>, <p>Users are more than happy to share something if it helps build long-term value for them. Go back to the original census conducted by William I in England. The Doomsday Book, or Liber de Wintonia, in 1086. There weren’t major riots; people generally did not hide the basics and recognized that sharing knowledge might help them. This is part of what we see in the idea of the wisdom of crowds. People get it, so stop hiding the potential value and show customers and consumers what you are doing with their data. 8 point legal riders do not count. Why do we fail to get nearly a thousand years later? </p>, <p><strong>Information, data is far more powerful when shared.</strong></p>, <p>The best data is usable in multiple ways for both the business and the consumer. Consumers want to do a better job of consuming and experiencing. Why not share insights with them. For example, the most enjoyable content, the best times to come to a restaurant or a website, what people like them do at a deep level. Educated consumers are better consumers than blind consumers. CEO’s should recognize the power of great data in their consumer’s hands is possibly better than the power of it in their hands. Once people see the value to the data they give, think about how much more they will share with you going forward? </p>, <p><strong>I hate the term data mining. Data is a currency not a mined mineral</strong></p>, <p>The heading probably says it all. The great value of data is that it is living currency. Where you get it from, how you use it, how it evolves is more like a currency than a raw mineral. You are not going to throw away minerals like gold, but you might throw away pieces of data. Mining also tends to infer extraction and not an application. CEO’s need to think only about the application. The fines we saw this week are the tip of the iceberg if your company doesn’t see data in the three dimensions discussed above. Protecting information is really tough, every Chief Security Officer will tell you that. More importantly though if your philosophy is not two way (us and the customer), it will be far too easy to slip into the errors these three brands fell into because these types of decisions about how to use data is handled below the water level like the nine-tenths of an iceberg.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c25=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I am the bestselling (Wall Street Journal and Amazon) author of the book, The Digital Helix, about the DNA of successful digital transformation traits of the 28% of corp...\">I am the bestselling (Wall Street Journal and Amazon) author of the book, The Digital Helix, about the DNA of successful digital transformation traits of the 28% of corp...</p>, <p _ngcontent-c25=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"The Thought Leadership section presents thought leadership content and original research from the Thought Leadership research division of Forbes Media.

      "['[Facebook\\'s proposed new cryptocurrency, Libra—the subject of hearings just now in Washington—is designed like a classic currency from the colonial period of history. Anyone presenting a unit of specified foreign exchange will get a proportional unit of Libra. For example, one dollar might get one Libra, one euro 1.1 Libras, 66 Indian rupees one Libra, and so on, based on the price Libra advertises in various global currencies. In the archetypical monetary arrangement of the colonial period, in the hundred years prior to the second World War, colonial currencies were available at a set rate to anyone presenting the British pound sterling., These two are emulating the major elements of the monetary system of yore, as if we need it again. Photocredit: Getty, This practice came to be known as a \"currency board.\" It fits the Libra proposal to a T. The idea under colonialism was that an independent local currency might not have very wide purchase, even in its own area. It might be overprinted, unrecognizable to many economic agents, and preferred less than more major currencies. The way to guarantee the local currency was to make handing over the pound (or in places, the dollar, the French franc, or gold) the only way of getting it. The currency board accepted the pound in exchange for the local currency unit, and vice versa. Internally, that unit was accepted as the pound would be. Externally, one returned the local unit to the currency board and got the globally accepted pound, on demand and automatically., It was precisely the high degree of \"automaticity\" of the currency boards that won over the public. Under a currency board, a local currency was automatically equivalent to the dominant global currency, the pound. Furthermore, no central bank at the local currency level was called for. All monetary production proceeded from the presentation of foreign exchange at the currency board., The main effect came in terms of investment. Investors piled into currency-board areas on the understanding that returns would come in the world\\'s top currency. The economic results were increases in opportunities and prosperity., There was a devil in the details. A currency board necessarily collected a large amount of pound sterling. A pile of the best currency has its temptations—namely for the local potentate to abscond with it, whatever the effects on the local issue from that point forward. With every success of a currency board came a greater temptation to abrogate the whole thing and pocket the foreign exchange., The colonial context was, therefore, essential to the functioning of currency boards. If ever a local currency board made off with British pounds, Britain itself could mete out punishments. These might include applying British law to the offending party, denying the convertibility of local notes, freezing out the area from imperial trade preferences, and pressing British power and prerogatives at the expense of local authorities. Such potential sanctions were enough to keep the currency-board reserves intact and untouched. Indeed, they were often held in Britain itself. This drove the point home: no touching these things., Modern currency boards, those that persisted or arose after 1945, lacked the oversight that faded with decolonization. The guarantees of the high-quality foreign-exchange stashes of currency boards had to come, if at all, in different forms., The most successful modern currency-board area is Hong Kong, which has maintained a U.S. dollar currency board for decades. Hong Kong has a fantastic incentive not to raid its dollar stash. Hong Kong is one of the very richest and freest places in the world and a shining example of what its immense neighbor China might aspire to be. Raiding its currency-board reserves would amount to self-mutilation on heroic scale., Other examples, though, follow a different course. Argentina has operated with a dollar-based currency board. After periods of success, though, the temptation has proven too great for certain challenged Argentine leaders not to liquidate the reserves. Inevitably\\xa0the reserve raids fund vote-buying schemes suggestive of Juan Perón\\'s diminution of the country\\'s immense gold stock of the World War II era for just that purpose., Argentina is not part of a colonial structure, because such things now belong to the ages, so it nominally gets away with this sort of behavior. The pale shadow of colonial watchfulness is the International Monetary Fund, created as it was in 1944 on the expectation of decolonization. Argentina has no problem taking on an international-organization paper tiger on the order of the IMF. The British Empire at its apogee, the IMF certainly is not., Currency boards really worked under colonialism. In modern times, they work according to the widely varying local levels of determination that they work. Facebook\\'s Libra consortium aspires to be a currency board accepting all sorts of high-level foreign exchange. The requirements and problems that come with currency boards are still there in this case., Obviously, there is no imperial structure mandating that the Libra currency board work. This is no small matter, given that this was the secret to the superior functioning of currency boards during their high season. Conceivably there is a substitute in the rule of law. Libra is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and promises to warehouse its reserves across important places in the developed world. This confers a strong sense that any attempt to make off with reserves, on the part of the Libra partnership, would face the brunt of the developed world\\'s contract and larceny laws., Yet if Libra succeeds, its owners should be paid, and perhaps getting paid will be misconstrued as larceny.\\xa0If Libra really succeeds, its reserves will be phenomenally large, perhaps much larger than any other corporate or personal fortune ever seen. There is no extant legal structure, even in the leading members of the advanced world, that has had to deal with that kind of scale of monetary ownership. Governments might get jealous; they are supposed to be the ones, they tell themselves, with the final claim on financial resources., This knotty problem might be seen as introducing the reverse of the classical currency board problem. The major nations might want to get their hands on the Libra reserve. Central banks are prepared\\xa0to act along these lines\\xa0as a matter of course. If, say, Libra were required to keep a fraction of its reserves with the Federal Reserve—and the current hearings are giving this impression—by that institution\\'s authority it could up reserve requirements tantamount to confiscating Libra\\'s holdings., This would represent a warping of the colonial precedent. Here major countries would prevent peripheral organizations from taking advantage of the global acceptability of their currencies. Colonial currency boards sought to do the opposite, to guarantee peripheral issues by making them equivalents of things like the pound and the dollar. Libra runs a clear risk of having the sovereigns of its reserve-asset issues raid those issues. In the face of such a prospect, we could do with a dash of colonialism again, of noblesse oblige, of letting people do good things with the dollar, the euro, etc. if they are able., Libra amounts to a major-currency exchange-traded fund. Like Bitcoin before it, which emulates gold, Libra is emulating currency boards. It is uncanny how the paradigmatic industries of the twenty-first century in technology and computer science are marking out the nature of the currency systems of the past, against official bewilderment that there is any need for such a thing., I’m a professor who’s interested in our economic history and the theory that went into making it – for good or ill. On this column, called Past &amp; Present, I write ab...]', '[*******************************************, July 15, 2019, Sen. Mike Crapo, Chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ranking Member, United States Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, July 16, 2019 Hearing, \\xa0, Dear Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown:\\xa0, I appreciate the opportunity to submit the following statement for your consideration, and would like to thank you and the members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. My background spans both the traditional financial system and digital assets, as I spent 22 years on Wall Street (most recently as managing director and head of Morgan Stanley’s pension solutions business in New York until 2016) and have been involved with digital assets for nearly 7 years. Presently, I serve on the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force as a gubernatorial appointee and am co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, which is continuing to build a welcoming framework for the digital asset industry’s regulatory compliance. I am purely a volunteer in both roles. This testimony is my own and should not be construed to represent the views of either organization.\\xa0, The Libra project is shining light on outdated U.S. financial regulations that are (a) holding back the U.S. economy and (b) giving rise to the concept of digital currency “stablecoins” in the first place.\\xa0, Digital currencies are the first major innovation in payment systems in nearly five decades. It is imperative that the U.S. tread carefully on this matter, since the genie is out of the bottle—digital currencies cannot be uninvented, and they offer significantly more efficient payment systems relative to those of the status quo. If we fight this technological trend, the innovation will simply move offshore rather than die.\\xa0, Below I expand on these four main points: (1) how outdated financial regulations caused the creation of stablecoins, which brought us to this juncture; (2) that digital currencies are the first major innovation in the payment system in decades; (3) that a model for how to fix U.S. federal regulations exists, and it can be found in Wyoming’s new blockchain laws; and (4) that Congress should be concerned about two particular issues pertaining to Facebook’s project: privacy and Federal Reserve interest payments.\\xa0, Banks have largely shunned the digital currency industry, making it difficult (if not impossible) for investors to trade U.S. dollars and digital currencies back and forth. If they could, investors would use the traditional banking system to do this, just as they do when trading stocks or commodities back and forth with dollars, but the traditional banking system has almost entirely blocked them. So, out of necessity the digital currency industry responded by inventing a “stablecoin”—a digital currency backed by dollars held in trust, whose trades settle on payment rails that are far more efficient than those of the traditional banking system, but which is also inextricably linked to the traditional banking system.\\xa0\\xa0, So, if Congress wants to make stablecoins irrelevant (including Libra), it can easily do so—simply by allowing the banking system to consistently bank this new asset class., To address the conditions that gave rise to stablecoins in the first place, Congress should:, Many banks have tried to fix the slumbering payment system and some are attempting to create their own blockchain-based alternative systems, but regulatory barriers have slowed the progress of these projects to a crawl comparatively. One such example is “Fnality,” formerly known as “Utility Settlement Coin,” which is making progress but is already nearly four years old., How does Facebook Libra fit into this?\\xa0, The basic building blocks of Facebook’s project are not new, with only one exception. The project is functionally akin to a money market fund (the Libra Association) plus a payment network (Calibra wallet), except that its transactions settle on a new type of payment system. The money market fund (Libra Association) invests in a basket of global currencies, government bonds and bank deposits. The payment network (Calibra wallet) is akin to a global version of PayPal or Venmo. The only difference, again, is that transactions in Libra settle on a new type of payment system—one that is far more efficient than any status quo payment system.\\xa0, It should surprise no one that there’s demand for a more efficient payment system. Already, the U.S. has lost the Libra Association to Switzerland, which has a more welcoming regulatory regime for blockchain projects than the U.S. This, too, should surprise no one., \\xa0, Within the past two years, Wyoming has developed a world-class regulatory framework for digital currencies like Libra and other digital assets, with the help of some of America’s top law firms and law professors. Here’s what Wyoming has done:, The Bank of England’s move to expand its interest-bearing deposit program to Facebook (and other tech companies) illustrates that the U.S. must tread carefully, as other countries will be courting Facebook to redomicile if U.S. regulation is too heavy-handed.\\xa0, To summarize, the Facebook Libra project is aimed at satisfying demand for a much more efficient payment system relative to the status quo. Congress should recognize that the U.S. is already playing catch-up. Our bad regulations caused the invention of stablecoins in the first place, which is what brought us here today. And Facebook already chose a non-U.S. location (Switzerland) for the Libra Association, in what should be recognized as a “shot across the bow” to the U.S. Rather than fight the first real innovation in payment systems in decades, the U.S. should embrace it. Wyoming’s suite of innovative blockchain laws shows that such an embrace can be done largely within the existing regulatory regime, in a manner that provides legal certainty, protects consumers and promotes innovation.\\xa0, I would be happy to answer questions as the Committee sees fit., \\xa0, I’m a 22-year Wall Street veteran who has been active in bitcoin since 2012, and whose passion is a fair and stable financial system. I saw inaccuracies in Wall Street’s...]', '[Facebook is meeting resistance from Congress and regulators to its proposed Libra cryptocurrency., There’s just one little problem: however cool Ethereum’s smart contracts may be, in practice a majority of smart contracts have bugs and security holes, as a study of tens of thousands of them has shown. Even worse, smart contracts are part of the “immutable ledger” that is supposed to make things secure. Except when there are bugs and security holes, it doesn’t., Facebook has quietly recognized that smart contracts are needed to make the primitive blockchain database even marginally practical, but that most smart contracts aren’t even modestly intelligent. How are they going to fix this problem?, Facebook has followed in this clear pattern. They actually spell out, in no uncertain terms, that existing smart contract implementations are dangerous things, riddled with bugs and filled with security holes. But it’s nearly impossible to build a marginally usable cryptocurrency system of the kind Facebook wants without them., Facebook is proud of its solution: a new software language called Move. Yes, a language called “Move.”, I’ve spent a little time checking out the new language. The developers are generally right about the deficiencies they are addressing, effectively endorsing the view that existing smart contracts are hopelessly flawed. They are smart and have put forward credible solutions to the problems. It’s just possible that, after a few years and after the software has gone open-source, the new system will turn out to be an improvement on the old one.\\xa0But before deciding that, let’s do something programmers avoid doing: take a quick look at history., I’ve got a bridge. It’s cheap – wanna buy it?, I started programming computers in high school. Before graduating with honors from Harvard College, I wrote code for oil refinery optimization and the ARPA-net. I then w...]', '[The reporting process, Facebook has launched a new tool for reporting scam ads in the UK, and says it may roll it out to other countries if it works., The tool was created as part of a legal settlement with British financial expert and broadcaster Martin Lewis, who runs the Moneysavingexpert.com financial advice site., It allows users to report an ad they believe to be fraudulent or misleading by clicking three dots in the top right-hand corner of every ad. This, says the firm, will alert a dedicated team within the company that will examine the ad and, if appropriate, take it down., Under the agreement, Facebook has also promised to give £3 million to the charity network Citizens Advice to help victims of online fraudsters specialist advice, either online, on the phone or face-to-face. As well as scam ads, the service will also help with other common scams such as antivirus and fake invoice messages; website scams like copycat sites; and investment scams that involve buying non-existent stocks, shares and other investments such as rare wine or art., \"Scam ads are an industry-wide problem caused by criminals and have no place on Facebook. Through our work with Martin Lewis, we’re taking a market leading position and our new reporting tool and dedicated team are important steps to stop the misuse of our platform,\" says Steve Hatch, Facebook\\'s vice president for Northern Europe., \"Prevention is also key. Our £3 million donation to Citizens Advice will not only help those who have been impacted by scammers, but raise awareness of how to avoid scams too.\", “The UK faces an epidemic of online scam ads – they’re everywhere. Yet disgracefully there’s little effective law or regulation to prevent them, and official enforcement is poor to non-existent, as these criminals are usually based outside of the EU,\" he says., \"Today should be the start of real improvement. The aim is to tap the power of what I’m dubbing ‘social policing’ to fight these scams. Millions of people know a scam when they see it, and millions of others don’t. So now, I’d ask all who recognise them to use the new Facebook reporting tool, to help protect those who don’t – which includes many who are vulnerable.\", For now, the tool is available only in the UK. However, a Facebook spokeswoman says the company is \\'certainly not ruling out the possibility of taking something like this to other markets if it works well\\'., There\\'s certainly a need: just last month, the company was forced to remove a series of fake bitcoin ads featuring\\xa0 the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. Actress Jennifer Anniston and, cheekily, Mark Zuckerberg\\'s wife Priscilla Chan have also had their images hijacked for scam ads., I\\'ve been writing about technology for most of my adult life, focusing mainly on legal and regulatory issues.

One of the co-founders of Oculus, however, is skeptical. In fact, Jack McCauley doesn’t think there’s a real market for VR gaming., “Video games have not evolved into a 3-D experience for a number of reasons,” he continued. “I don’t know what kind of application it would be for VR that would keep players plugged in for six hours like they do with game consoles.”, Many people have different ideas of what success means within virtual reality. With so many standards yet to be nailed down, no one’s specific take stands above the rest and the industry continues to innovate and iterate. McCauley, however, was a founder for one of the pivotal VR headsets and some would think that role made him an informed evangelist or even biased toward the technology but it seems he was skeptical from the beginning., “You put it on, and there’s a lot of ‘Wow!’ to it, but then what do you do with it?” McCauley said. “Even when I was there I thought people weren’t going to wear a headset and walk around with it in public.”, Keep in mind that McCauley seems to only be speaking on virtual reality as it pertains to the gaming industry. VR itself is being used across a plethora of industries, including vehicle engineering and medical training, so the technology itself will likely persist. There’s always a chance that the steady growth of VR gaming could taper off and he seems confident that will be the outcome., “I may be wrong, but I’ve been doing this a long time,” he said. “I’ve already done a lot of what people do mistake-wise. You have your gut, and it tells you if you’re right or wrong. And in this case I think I’m right.”]\", \"[The head of Facebook’s cryptocurrency subsidiary Calibra, David Marcus, testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. , Facebook says it’s willing to work with U.S. regulators prior to offering its budding cryptocurrency Libra to the public, a concession that seemed designed to appease a bipartisan group of lawmakers who fear adoption by the company’s 2.38 billion registered users could undermine the stability of the global financial system and give Facebook access to too much personal financial information., He defended the cryptocurrency by emphasizing that in order to use Facebook’s Calibra digital wallet you would need to create a new account and use a government-issued ID to confirm your identity. He said Facebook believes this form of authentication will deter criminals from using the currency for nefarious purposes., “The way that we think about protecting the integrity of the network against money laundering, criminal activity and terrorism funding is by moving a lot of cash transactions into the digital world. Cash transactions are where most crimes happen,” he said. “The way we are applying [anti-money-laundering] programs as far as the Calibra wallet is concerned, we will have strong identity [protections].”, Trump tweeted on Thursday that he is “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.“ He added, “Facebook Libra's ‘virtual currency’ will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National and International.”, Senators also chastised Facebook for failing to prevent misuse of consumer data in the past, included its admission last year that a political-ad-targeting firm had improperly gained access to more than 87 million users. “Facebook has demonstrated through scandal after scandal that it doesn’t deserve our trust. It should be treated like the profit-seeking corporation it is, just like any other company,” said Senator Sherrod Brown (D- Ohio)., He cited other privacy breaches, such as the millions of fake posts spread by a Russian propaganda firm during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Now Facebook asks people to trust them with their hard-earned paychecks. It takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance to look at that track record and think, ‘You know, really what we really ought to do next? Let’s run our own bank and our own for-profit version of the Federal Reserve. Let’s do it for the whole world.’”, Facebook plans to make money from Libra eventually, but the company has no immediate plans to use transaction data for advertising purposes. Answering questions about the long-term opportunity for Facebook, Marcus said, “It’s the ability for the 90 million small businesses [on Facebook] to transact with one another. And if there’s more commerce, there will be more advertising revenue for Facebook. More commercial activity on Facebook equals more money for Facebook.”, I'm an associate editor at Forbes covering Facebook and social media. I previously worked as an editor for Popular Science, Gizmodo, and Mashable leading investigations]\", '[David Marcus , Facebook wants forgiveness. And to earn that forgiveness, the social media giant that was accused of allowing its users\\' personal data to be used by the controversial political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica has an uncanny plan. It’s going to use cryptocurrency, which was originally popularized as a way to anonymously buy drugs, to connect people without bank accounts to the global economy. That, and it will likely have to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the alleged privacy violations., The secret to this seemingly impossible task is that Facebook and the other companies in the nonprofit Libra Association have promised that every libra will be backed by stable assets, almost certainly including the U.S. dollar and government treasury bonds. While some central banks, like the Bank of England, have already reacted positively to the news their currency could be locked up in accounts held by private companies, the U.S. Federal Reserve has expressed concerns. President Donald Trump has called for the companies to get a banking charter, and multiple members of Congress have asked for a moratorium on development of the cryptocurrency until more is known., “Clearly we made mistakes in the past, and it’s a top priority for Mark [Zuckerberg] and the rest the leadership team to really address this,” says Marcus, who previously served as a board member for cryptocurrency startup Coinbase. “And as far as I’m concerned I see libra as an opportunity to demonstrate that we have learned and we are a different company now than we were.”, Forbes, While Marcus’ submitted comments call such privacy a “top priority” for the Libra Association, he adds that the ultimate regulator in charge is not even in the U.S., since to the nonprofit organization\\'s headquarters are in Geneva. “For the purposes of data and privacy protections, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) will be the Libra Association’s privacy regulator,” his notes read. , Regarding the project’s stance on privacy, Marcus says the Libra Association “cannot, and will not, monetize data on the blockchain,” though he is notably silent on how Calibra, the Facebook-owned wallet for buying, holding and storing cryptocurrency will use or not use customer data, saying only that “Calibra customers’ account and financial information will not be shared with Facebook” and leaving the door open for other possible uses., “As a consumer, no matter which wallet you choose, you’re going to get the benefit of the scale of the network,” says Marcus. “And for that reason we really need to earn consumers’ trust if we want to have a fighting chance.” Further competition will likely come from fellow fiat-backed stablecoins like Circle’s USD Coin and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’s Gemini Dollar, which also already have live products, while MakerDao and soon-to-be launched Celo offer similar stability without fiat currency at all., The second misunderstanding Marcus hopes to clarify to Congress is that critics, he says, have inaccurately portrayed libra as a weakening of central bank monetary supply controls, especially the ability to buy back government bonds as a way to increase demand for a currency. Since the Libra Association is committed to a 1:1 pairing of the value of currency, bonds and other assets stored in banks around the world with the value of the libra cryptocurrency in circulation, Marcus says monetary supply controls won’t be impacted. Should a central bank seek to buy back treasury bonds owned by the association, the association could compensate for that by purchasing other assets in different jurisdictions., “The Libra Association has no ability to create more libra than there are corresponding value in reserve. There’s no way to print money,” says Marcus. “The monetary policy of the assets that are contained in the basket gets transferred as a unit of digital currency that represents the underlying asset.” , Marcus sounds prepared for the long haul. “We will have to not only make very strong commitments when it comes to serving our customers,\" he says. “But we will have to live up to them for a very long period of time.”, I report on how blockchain and cryptocurrencies are being adopted by enterprises and the broader business community. My coverage includes the use of cryptocurrencies su]', \"[French President Emmanuel Macron. France is imposing a new digital\\xa0tax\\xa0targeting\\xa0Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.\\xa0, As with all corporate taxes, there is a widespread\\xa0misunderstanding as to who actually pays the tax. Since in order to stay in business, customers have to cover all of a company's costs -- including taxes -- it is customers who ultimately pay the taxes., The French estimate that the new tax will yield 500 million euros a year. That may be so, but it will not reduce these companies' profits, they are merely the tax collectors., This does not mean these companies will be unscathed. There will be unintended but predictable side effects., Apple and Amazon will be easier to compete with within France at least until their competitors grow big enough to be subject to the tax. Still, I'd bet on Apple and Amazon even if their competitors have a 3% tax advantage., No one ever bought an Apple product because it was the cheapest alternative. And, with all the shenanigans that can occur when you buy things over the internet, Amazon's A to Z Guarantee is a good reason for the French to continue to shop on Amazon even if competitors prices are slightly lower., In addition, the companies that compete with Amazon and Apple may not hold their prices constant. Instead, they could raise their prices by 3%, but since they are not subject to the tax, they will just keep the money., Since Google and Facebook get their revenue from selling ads, the new tax makes it that much harder for a French company to win an auction for ad space on either platform. In fact, in every case where a French company won the bidding for an ad slot, there was a second-place bidder not far behind., If Google and Facebook simply refused to sell ads to French companies (so as not to trigger the tax), the second-place bidder would take the ad space at a not very much lower price.

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg, Facebook previously announced plans for launching a new cryptocurrency, Libra. The company didn’t, however, discuss how this new digital currency could completely change and shake up the banking and financial establishment. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg downplayed the new currency, claiming that it will be governed by a regulatory body in Switzerland and has a number of well respected participating institutions behind it.\\xa0, Many doubt his assertions and believe that this is a power play to further grow his company and its span of control. If the billions of people who use Facebook decided to conduct transactions with Libra, it would jeopardize the United States and other country’s currencies and financial systems. While lightly covered, having one extremely powerful company control the flow of money, U.S. currency could suffer serious repercussions. Politicians slowly awakened to this danger and demanded that Facebook executives meet with congress.\\xa0\\xa0, It seems that Democrats and Republicans alike finally agree on something—the threat Facebook\\'s new currency will have on the country. Tuesday, Facebook found itself once again under fire from Congress. The Senate Banking Committee grilled Facebook executive David Marcus—as CEO Mark Zuckerburg smartly avoided a return trip to the woodshed—concerning the company’s plan to launch its digital currency., The members of Congress did not look fondly on Facebook’s new initiative. Senator Sherrod Brown openly professed his displeasure and claimed that “through scandal after scandal...it doesn\\'t deserve our trust.\" Brown said, \"We\\'d be crazy to give them a chance to let them experiment with people\\'s bank accounts.\" He further added that it was \"delusional\" for customers to trust Facebook with their \"hard-earned\" money.\\xa0 Other senators shared their concerns. \"I don\\'t trust you guys,\" said Republican Senator Martha McSally. \"Instead of cleaning up your house, you are launching into a new business model,\" she complained.\\xa0, Marcus, who was formerly a high-ranking executive at PayPal, tried—without much success—to get Congress on his side. He promised that Facebook would not begin offering Libra until important regulatory issues are dealt with.\\xa0, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has affirmed that he is uncomfortable with Libra. Mnuchin stated that Libra “could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers” and it was a “national security issue.” He said, “Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity, like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human trafficking.”\\xa0\\xa0, I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity...., When you have the president, secretary of the treasury, Fed chairman, Republicans and Democrats all agreeing on something, you know they are scared—and their fear is justified. How do you stop a company that\\'s a money-making machine, recently paid a $5 billion fine like it\\'s a parking ticket to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, consistently ignored privacy concerns of its users, allowed the spread of Russion disinformation, accused of stifling free speech on its platform, chastised by Congress and still pushes ahead without remorse, humility or apologies?\\xa0, The crypto market will explode to the upside. Wealth for holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will soar. Jobs will be created to deal with the incredible growth. In particular, thousands of compliance, legal, risk, audit and regulatory positions will be created to watch over this new rapidly changing sector. Meanwhile, more jobs will be cut at traditional banks, as there will be a race toward moving away from them and toward FinTech-type companies.\\xa0, Facebook could expand upon its currency and become one of the largest banking institutions overnight. It would be hard for giants, such as J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, to compete with a platform that has literally billions of users each day. Facebook knows every move their members make and will certainly use it to the company’s advantage. The entire business landscape could dramatically change. Those who will be part of the Libra and cryptocurrency team will enjoy money, power and opportunities.

Photographer: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg, The Breakdown You Need to Know, Normally we would tell you that a fine of this magnitude would really impact Facebook, unfortunately the company will barely notice. The social media giant brought in $15.1 billion in revenues in Q1 this year, leaving many investors unbothered. Facebook stock is now up 48% on the year and $5 billion is about 9% of its total revenue for 2018, which landed at $55.83 billion., Social Oversights, We can also look at Facebook’s lack of diversity as being part of the problem and how they ended up in this mess to begin with. The social media giant’s workforce and leadership is only 3% black and this continued lack of diversity at Facebook hinders it from identifying ways their product might harm certain customers., When it comes to data breaches they are often more problematic for people of color living on fixed or low incomes, or from other marginalized communities.

But in 2019, improvements to the Facebook integration have led to a dramatic uptick in peer-to-peer donations: more than $1.2 million and counting, an increase of more than 2,300%., “Since starting the PMC in 1980, we’ve worked to be innovative and lead on fundraising trends,” said\\xa0Billy Starr, PMC Founder and Executive Director.\\xa0“We were a pioneer of athletic fundraising and one of the first nonprofits to implement online peer-to-peer giving in 2000, but we continue to look for new ways to raise the bar as we grow.\", \"Our 100 percent pass-through rate is incredibly important to us and our community, which means each year we need to proactively reach new donors to ensure we’re able to maintain it,\" Starr added. \"As we approach our 40th\\xa0ride, integrating further with Facebook was a natural progression and it has paid off in dividends – nearly 50% of the 16,000+ Facebook donors are giving to the PMC for the first time.”, To make it easier for people and communities to raise money on Facebook, Facebook\\'s free tools to help people collect donations and enable supporters to fundraise for nonprofits.

Perhaps, the crisp Swiss air will inspire the various delegates — 27 companies have announced partnerships with Facebook — to firm up their nonbinding agreements. Or, maybe the scrutiny that Facebook has received, the criticism coming from governments and techies, and the doubts expressed by cryptocurrency experts will drive some companies to withdraw. As enthusiastic as I personally am about cryptocurrency and its potential to change the world for the better, the things that I have read, watched, and discussed since the Libra news broke out have left me suspicious about Facebook’s goals and methods. I know that I’m not the only one who has doubts., In just 15 years of operation, Facebook has acquired over two billion users. Millions of people who don’t use the flagship product nonetheless have daily interactions with the company, which owns both WhatsApp and Instagram. Given the meteoric pace of Facebook’s rise, it is not surprising that the company’s plans tend to be ambitious and its implementations usually swift. In the case of Libra, however, Facebook may have attempted too much too quickly., Libra won’t link its valuation to a preexisting “fiat” currency issued by a government, and Facebook wants its cryptocurrency to be global. Does that sound like any other cryptocurrency? If you said that it sounds just like Bitcoin, the first and still the most trusted cryptocurrency, you’d be entirely correct. Bitcoin has existed for over a decade, and even those who prefer other currencies at least acknowledge the strength of the Bitcoin community and the trustworthiness of the currency’s algorithms. Banks, corporations, and governments have been afraid of cryptocurrencies for years, and, for the majority of them, it was too late to get involved to fully capitalize on the inevitable decentralized payment adoption.

The fact that the game involves hidden information—you don’t know your opponents’ cards—means that success requires bluffing and other tactics that don\\'t apply to many other games. This has made poker resistant to AI techniques that have produced breakthroughs in other games. Researchers have been able to develop AIs that can beat one other player at no-limit Texas hold\\'em poker, but multiplayer has been too difficult to crack. , Pluribus mastered multiplayer Texas hold\\'em by playing against previous versions of itself. This \"self-play\" learning method means that it was not fed any data from humans and it did not observe games played by other AI systems either.    , \"The AI starts from scratch by playing randomly and gradually improves as it determines which actions and which probability distribution over those actions lead to better outcomes against earlier versions of its strategy,\" Brown and Sandholm write in their paper. This strategy has been used before. For example, Google DeepMind used it to crack Go and OpenAI used it to master Dota 2. , Journalist  Cade Metz (L) and Facebook\\'s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun (R). , AI researchers have been using games as a testbed for their AI agents for decades and in recent years there have been a number of breakthroughs thanks to advances in computing, better data sets, and more sophisticated AI techniques. Tech giants are investing heavily into the space in the hope that gaming breakthroughs will lead to breakthroughs in other areas such as healthcare, science, and energy. , \"These innovations have important implications beyond poker, because two-player zero-sum interactions (in which one player wins and one player loses) are common in recreational games, but they are very rare in real life,\" write the researchers in a blog post. \"Real-world scenarios—such as bidding in an online auction or navigating traffic—typically involve multiple actors.\", Pluribus beat top-ranked professional players in both a five AIs plus one human player format and a one AI plus five professionals format. Among the professionals were Chris Ferguson, the World Series of Poker champion, and Darren Elias, an American pro who holds the record for winning the most World Poker Tour titles. , There was no money at stake but the researchers claim that if each chip was worth a dollar, Pluribus would have won an average of about $5 per hand and would have made about $1,000 per hour playing against five humans. , Pluribus is a supercharged version of another AI bot called Libratus, which beat human pros in two-player Texas hold’em games in 2017.  , Unlike Libratus, Pluribus contains a new online search algorithm that can evaluate its options by searching a few moves ahead, as well as faster self-play algorithms. , The combination of these two factors made it possible to train Pluribus using relatively little processing power and memory. The researchers say they required just $150 worth of cloud computing resources. \"This efficiency stands in stark contrast to other recent AI milestone projects, which required the equivalent of millions of dollars’ worth of computing resources to train,\" they write. , \"Pluribus is a very hard opponent to play against,\" said Ferguson. \"It’s really hard to pin him down on any kind of hand. He’s also very good at making thin value bets on the river and extracting value out of his good hands.\", Elias added that Pluribus\\'s main strength is its ability to use mixed strategies, which is what humans try to do. , \"It’s a matter of execution for humans–to do this in a perfectly random way and to do so consistently,\" he says. \"Most people just can’t. The bot wasn’t just playing against some middle of the road pros. It was playing some of the best players in the world.\", While Pluribus might send a shiver down the spine of professional poker players that make a living from winning online tournaments, they don\\'t need to worry about coming up against Pluribus in their next match. , I\\'m a Staff Writer covering tech in Europe.

It is not confirmed yet, but the FTC has agreed a $5bn fine for Facebook, and its involvement with the collection and analysis of approximately 84,000,000 Facebook accounts information by Cambridge Analytica. , There is always going to be a dispute about was it a process of illicit collection, inappropriate analysis and usage. But the elongated journey to get to this point is a bad week for corporations playing the wild, wild, west with data from their customers. Look at British Airways this week in the UK and Marriott too in the UK. $130M fine for Marriott and $230M for British Airways. $350m+ in a week, $5.5bn in total. These fines may not sound significant, but in one week it is equal to the total services exports from the US to Belgium in 2017, or the potential value of the digital signature market by 2025, or the size of the Pacemaker market in 2017. Maybe silly comparisons, but not small ones. We are one week into this and more will come as governing bodies develop an appetite to copy what happened this week. , Network Big Data Transfer, We cannot escape a very basic truth that our data has value. Now we need to all respect that., Everybody knows that we are entering an age where new things from bitcoin to the fractional and combined values of your data (physical and digital) must have some value because Google and Facebook make a pile of money from mining it and putting it all together for advertisers. Take the data away and what do these and other media brands have assets? , So, what is going wrong to take for us to get this, right? There is a deep lack of understanding about what data is. It is, in effect, a currency, a two-day promise from user to company and from company to user about respecting what the exchange of it means. , Even in 1086, users understood the interchange value of data. William, the Conqueror, got it., Users are more than happy to share something if it helps build long-term value for them. Go back to the original census conducted by William I in England. The Doomsday Book, or Liber de Wintonia, in 1086. There weren’t major riots; people generally did not hide the basics and recognized that sharing knowledge might help them. This is part of what we see in the idea of the wisdom of crowds. People get it, so stop hiding the potential value and show customers and consumers what you are doing with their data. 8 point legal riders do not count. Why do we fail to get nearly a thousand years later? , Information, data is far more powerful when shared., The best data is usable in multiple ways for both the business and the consumer. Consumers want to do a better job of consuming and experiencing. Why not share insights with them. For example, the most enjoyable content, the best times to come to a restaurant or a website, what people like them do at a deep level. Educated consumers are better consumers than blind consumers. CEO’s should recognize the power of great data in their consumer’s hands is possibly better than the power of it in their hands. Once people see the value to the data they give, think about how much more they will share with you going forward? , I hate the term data mining. Data is a currency not a mined mineral, The heading probably says it all. The great value of data is that it is living currency. Where you get it from, how you use it, how it evolves is more like a currency than a raw mineral. You are not going to throw away minerals like gold, but you might throw away pieces of data. Mining also tends to infer extraction and not an application. CEO’s need to think only about the application. The fines we saw this week are the tip of the iceberg if your company doesn’t see data in the three dimensions discussed above. Protecting information is really tough, every Chief Security Officer will tell you that.

      "['Facebook\\'s proposed new cryptocurrency, Libra—the subject of hearings just now in Washington—is designed like a classic currency from the colonial period of history. Anyone presenting a unit of specified foreign exchange will get a proportional unit of Libra. For example, one dollar might get one Libra, one euro 1.1 Libras, 66 Indian rupees one Libra, and so on, based on the price Libra advertises in various global currencies. In the archetypical monetary arrangement of the colonial period, in the hundred years prior to the second World War, colonial currencies were available at a set rate to anyone presenting the British pound sterling., These two are emulating the major elements of the monetary system of yore, as if we need it again. Photocredit: Getty, This practice came to be known as a \"currency board.\" It fits the Libra proposal to a T. The idea under colonialism was that an independent local currency might not have very wide purchase, even in its own area. It might be overprinted, unrecognizable to many economic agents, and preferred less than more major currencies. The way to guarantee the local currency was to make handing over the pound (or in places, the dollar, the French franc, or gold) the only way of getting it. The currency board accepted the pound in exchange for the local currency unit, and vice versa. Internally, that unit was accepted as the pound would be. Externally, one returned the local unit to the currency board and got the globally accepted pound, on demand and automatically., It was precisely the high degree of \"automaticity\" of the currency boards that won over the public. Under a currency board, a local currency was automatically equivalent to the dominant global currency, the pound. Furthermore, no central bank at the local currency level was called for. All monetary production proceeded from the presentation of foreign exchange at the currency board., The main effect came in terms of investment. Investors piled into currency-board areas on the understanding that returns would come in the world\\'s top currency. The economic results were increases in opportunities and prosperity., There was a devil in the details. A currency board necessarily collected a large amount of pound sterling. A pile of the best currency has its temptations—namely for the local potentate to abscond with it, whatever the effects on the local issue from that point forward. With every success of a currency board came a greater temptation to abrogate the whole thing and pocket the foreign exchange., The colonial context was, therefore, essential to the functioning of currency boards. If ever a local currency board made off with British pounds, Britain itself could mete out punishments. These might include applying British law to the offending party, denying the convertibility of local notes, freezing out the area from imperial trade preferences, and pressing British power and prerogatives at the expense of local authorities. Such potential sanctions were enough to keep the currency-board reserves intact and untouched. Indeed, they were often held in Britain itself. This drove the point home: no touching these things., Modern currency boards, those that persisted or arose after 1945, lacked the oversight that faded with decolonization. The guarantees of the high-quality foreign-exchange stashes of currency boards had to come, if at all, in different forms., The most successful modern currency-board area is Hong Kong, which has maintained a U.S. dollar currency board for decades. Hong Kong has a fantastic incentive not to raid its dollar stash. Hong Kong is one of the very richest and freest places in the world and a shining example of what its immense neighbor China might aspire to be. Raiding its currency-board reserves would amount to self-mutilation on heroic scale., Other examples, though, follow a different course. Argentina has operated with a dollar-based currency board. After periods of success, though, the temptation has proven too great for certain challenged Argentine leaders not to liquidate the reserves. Inevitably the reserve raids fund vote-buying schemes suggestive of Juan Perón\\'s diminution of the country\\'s immense gold stock of the World War II era for just that purpose., Argentina is not part of a colonial structure, because such things now belong to the ages, so it nominally gets away with this sort of behavior. The pale shadow of colonial watchfulness is the International Monetary Fund, created as it was in 1944 on the expectation of decolonization. Argentina has no problem taking on an international-organization paper tiger on the order of the IMF. The British Empire at its apogee, the IMF certainly is not., Currency boards really worked under colonialism. In modern times, they work according to the widely varying local levels of determination that they work. Facebook\\'s Libra consortium aspires to be a currency board accepting all sorts of high-level foreign exchange. The requirements and problems that come with currency boards are still there in this case., Obviously, there is no imperial structure mandating that the Libra currency board work. This is no small matter, given that this was the secret to the superior functioning of currency boards during their high season. Conceivably there is a substitute in the rule of law. Libra is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and promises to warehouse its reserves across important places in the developed world. This confers a strong sense that any attempt to make off with reserves, on the part of the Libra partnership, would face the brunt of the developed world\\'s contract and larceny laws., Yet if Libra succeeds, its owners should be paid, and perhaps getting paid will be misconstrued as larceny. If Libra really succeeds, its reserves will be phenomenally large, perhaps much larger than any other corporate or personal fortune ever seen. There is no extant legal structure, even in the leading members of the advanced world, that has had to deal with that kind of scale of monetary ownership. Governments might get jealous; they are supposed to be the ones, they tell themselves, with the final claim on financial resources., This knotty problem might be seen as introducing the reverse of the classical currency board problem. The major nations might want to get their hands on the Libra reserve. Central banks are prepared to act along these lines as a matter of course. If, say, Libra were required to keep a fraction of its reserves with the Federal Reserve—and the current hearings are giving this impression—by that institution\\'s authority it could up reserve requirements tantamount to confiscating Libra\\'s holdings., This would represent a warping of the colonial precedent. Here major countries would prevent peripheral organizations from taking advantage of the global acceptability of their currencies. Colonial currency boards sought to do the opposite, to guarantee peripheral issues by making them equivalents of things like the pound and the dollar. Libra runs a clear risk of having the sovereigns of its reserve-asset issues raid those issues. In the face of such a prospect, we could do with a dash of colonialism again, of noblesse oblige, of letting people do good things with the dollar, the euro, etc. if they are able., Libra amounts to a major-currency exchange-traded fund. Like Bitcoin before it, which emulates gold, Libra is emulating currency boards. It is uncanny how the paradigmatic industries of the twenty-first century in technology and computer science are marking out the nature of the currency systems of the past, against official bewilderment that there is any need for such a thing., I’m a professor who’s interested in our economic history and the theory that went into making it – for good or ill. On this column, called Past &amp; Present, I write ab...', '*******************************************, July 15, 2019, Sen. Mike Crapo, Chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ranking Member, United States Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, July 16, 2019 Hearing,  , Dear Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown: , I appreciate the opportunity to submit the following statement for your consideration, and would like to thank you and the members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. My background spans both the traditional financial system and digital assets, as I spent 22 years on Wall Street (most recently as managing director and head of Morgan Stanley’s pension solutions business in New York until 2016) and have been involved with digital assets for nearly 7 years. Presently, I serve on the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force as a gubernatorial appointee and am co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, which is continuing to build a welcoming framework for the digital asset industry’s regulatory compliance. I am purely a volunteer in both roles. This testimony is my own and should not be construed to represent the views of either organization. , The Libra project is shining light on outdated U.S. financial regulations that are (a) holding back the U.S. economy and (b) giving rise to the concept of digital currency “stablecoins” in the first place. , Digital currencies are the first major innovation in payment systems in nearly five decades. It is imperative that the U.S. tread carefully on this matter, since the genie is out of the bottle—digital currencies cannot be uninvented, and they offer significantly more efficient payment systems relative to those of the status quo. If we fight this technological trend, the innovation will simply move offshore rather than die. , Below I expand on these four main points: (1) how outdated financial regulations caused the creation of stablecoins, which brought us to this juncture; (2) that digital currencies are the first major innovation in the payment system in decades; (3) that a model for how to fix U.S. federal regulations exists, and it can be found in Wyoming’s new blockchain laws; and (4) that Congress should be concerned about two particular issues pertaining to Facebook’s project: privacy and Federal Reserve interest payments. , Banks have largely shunned the digital currency industry, making it difficult (if not impossible) for investors to trade U.S. dollars and digital currencies back and forth. If they could, investors would use the traditional banking system to do this, just as they do when trading stocks or commodities back and forth with dollars, but the traditional banking system has almost entirely blocked them. So, out of necessity the digital currency industry responded by inventing a “stablecoin”—a digital currency backed by dollars held in trust, whose trades settle on payment rails that are far more efficient than those of the traditional banking system, but which is also inextricably linked to the traditional banking system.  , So, if Congress wants to make stablecoins irrelevant (including Libra), it can easily do so—simply by allowing the banking system to consistently bank this new asset class., To address the conditions that gave rise to stablecoins in the first place, Congress should:, Many banks have tried to fix the slumbering payment system and some are attempting to create their own blockchain-based alternative systems, but regulatory barriers have slowed the progress of these projects to a crawl comparatively. One such example is “Fnality,” formerly known as “Utility Settlement Coin,” which is making progress but is already nearly four years old., How does Facebook Libra fit into this? , The basic building blocks of Facebook’s project are not new, with only one exception. The project is functionally akin to a money market fund (the Libra Association) plus a payment network (Calibra wallet), except that its transactions settle on a new type of payment system. The money market fund (Libra Association) invests in a basket of global currencies, government bonds and bank deposits. The payment network (Calibra wallet) is akin to a global version of PayPal or Venmo. The only difference, again, is that transactions in Libra settle on a new type of payment system—one that is far more efficient than any status quo payment system. , It should surprise no one that there’s demand for a more efficient payment system. Already, the U.S. has lost the Libra Association to Switzerland, which has a more welcoming regulatory regime for blockchain projects than the U.S. This, too, should surprise no one.,  , Within the past two years, Wyoming has developed a world-class regulatory framework for digital currencies like Libra and other digital assets, with the help of some of America’s top law firms and law professors. Here’s what Wyoming has done:, The Bank of England’s move to expand its interest-bearing deposit program to Facebook (and other tech companies) illustrates that the U.S. must tread carefully, as other countries will be courting Facebook to redomicile if U.S. regulation is too heavy-handed. , To summarize, the Facebook Libra project is aimed at satisfying demand for a much more efficient payment system relative to the status quo. Congress should recognize that the U.S. is already playing catch-up. Our bad regulations caused the invention of stablecoins in the first place, which is what brought us here today. And Facebook already chose a non-U.S. location (Switzerland) for the Libra Association, in what should be recognized as a “shot across the bow” to the U.S. Rather than fight the first real innovation in payment systems in decades, the U.S. should embrace it. Wyoming’s suite of innovative blockchain laws shows that such an embrace can be done largely within the existing regulatory regime, in a manner that provides legal certainty, protects consumers and promotes innovation. , I would be happy to answer questions as the Committee sees fit.,  , I’m a 22-year Wall Street veteran who has been active in bitcoin since 2012, and whose passion is a fair and stable financial system. I saw inaccuracies in Wall Street’s...', 'Facebook is meeting resistance from Congress and regulators to its proposed Libra cryptocurrency., There’s just one little problem: however cool Ethereum’s smart contracts may be, in practice a majority of smart contracts have bugs and security holes, as a study of tens of thousands of them has shown. Even worse, smart contracts are part of the “immutable ledger” that is supposed to make things secure. Except when there are bugs and security holes, it doesn’t., Facebook has quietly recognized that smart contracts are needed to make the primitive blockchain database even marginally practical, but that most smart contracts aren’t even modestly intelligent. How are they going to fix this problem?, Facebook has followed in this clear pattern. They actually spell out, in no uncertain terms, that existing smart contract implementations are dangerous things, riddled with bugs and filled with security holes. But it’s nearly impossible to build a marginally usable cryptocurrency system of the kind Facebook wants without them., Facebook is proud of its solution: a new software language called Move. Yes, a language called “Move.”, I’ve spent a little time checking out the new language. The developers are generally right about the deficiencies they are addressing, effectively endorsing the view that existing smart contracts are hopelessly flawed. They are smart and have put forward credible solutions to the problems. It’s just possible that, after a few years and after the software has gone open-source, the new system will turn out to be an improvement on the old one. But before deciding that, let’s do something programmers avoid doing: take a quick look at history., I’ve got a bridge. It’s cheap – wanna buy it?, I started programming computers in high school. Before graduating with honors from Harvard College, I wrote code for oil refinery optimization and the ARPA-net. I then w...', 'The reporting process, Facebook has launched a new tool for reporting scam ads in the UK, and says it may roll it out to other countries if it works., The tool was created as part of a legal settlement with British financial expert and broadcaster Martin Lewis, who runs the Moneysavingexpert.com financial advice site., It allows users to report an ad they believe to be fraudulent or misleading by clicking three dots in the top right-hand corner of every ad. This, says the firm, will alert a dedicated team within the company that will examine the ad and, if appropriate, take it down., Under the agreement, Facebook has also promised to give £3 million to the charity network Citizens Advice to help victims of online fraudsters specialist advice, either online, on the phone or face-to-face. As well as scam ads, the service will also help with other common scams such as antivirus and fake invoice messages; website scams like copycat sites; and investment scams that involve buying non-existent stocks, shares and other investments such as rare wine or art., \"Scam ads are an industry-wide problem caused by criminals and have no place on Facebook. Through our work with Martin Lewis, we’re taking a market leading position and our new reporting tool and dedicated team are important steps to stop the misuse of our platform,\" says Steve Hatch, Facebook\\'s vice president for Northern Europe., \"Prevention is also key. Our £3 million donation to Citizens Advice will not only help those who have been impacted by scammers, but raise awareness of how to avoid scams too.\", “The UK faces an epidemic of online scam ads – they’re everywhere. Yet disgracefully there’s little effective law or regulation to prevent them, and official enforcement is poor to non-existent, as these criminals are usually based outside of the EU,\" he says., \"Today should be the start of real improvement. The aim is to tap the power of what I’m dubbing ‘social policing’ to fight these scams. Millions of people know a scam when they see it, and millions of others don’t. So now, I’d ask all who recognise them to use the new Facebook reporting tool, to help protect those who don’t – which includes many who are vulnerable.\", For now, the tool is available only in the UK. However, a Facebook spokeswoman says the company is \\'certainly not ruling out the possibility of taking something like this to other markets if it works well\\'., There\\'s certainly a need: just last month, the company was forced to remove a series of fake bitcoin ads featuring  the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. Actress Jennifer Anniston and, cheekily, Mark Zuckerberg\\'s wife Priscilla Chan have also had their images hijacked for scam ads., I\\'ve been writing about technology for most of my adult life, focusing mainly on legal and regulatory issues. I write for a wide range of publications: credits include t...', \"The wireless and untethered Quest, Oculus's latest hardware release., Outside perception of Facebook’s virtual reality efforts seem encouraging, especially hot off the release of the wireless, untethered VR HMD Oculus Quest. One of the co-founders of Oculus, however, is skeptical. In fact, Jack McCauley doesn’t think there’s a real market for VR gaming., “Video games have not evolved into a 3-D experience for a number of reasons,” he continued. “I don’t know what kind of application it would be for VR that would keep players plugged in for six hours like they do with game consoles.”, Many people have different ideas of what success means within virtual reality. With so many standards yet to be nailed down, no one’s specific take stands above the rest and the industry continues to innovate and iterate. McCauley, however, was a founder for one of the pivotal VR headsets and some would think that role made him an informed evangelist or even biased toward the technology but it seems he was skeptical from the beginning., “You put it on, and there’s a lot of ‘Wow!’ to it, but then what do you do with it?” McCauley said. “Even when I was there I thought people weren’t going to wear a headset and walk around with it in public.”, Keep in mind that McCauley seems to only be speaking on virtual reality as it pertains to the gaming industry. VR itself is being used across a plethora of industries, including vehicle engineering and medical training, so the technology itself will likely persist. There’s always a chance that the steady growth of VR gaming could taper off and he seems confident that will be the outcome., “I may be wrong, but I’ve been doing this a long time,” he said. “I’ve already done a lot of what people do mistake-wise. You have your gut, and it tells you if you’re right or wrong. And in this case I think I’m right.”\", \"The head of Facebook’s cryptocurrency subsidiary Calibra, David Marcus, testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. , Facebook says it’s willing to work with U.S. regulators prior to offering its budding cryptocurrency Libra to the public, a concession that seemed designed to appease a bipartisan group of lawmakers who fear adoption by the company’s 2.38 billion registered users could undermine the stability of the global financial system and give Facebook access to too much personal financial information., He defended the cryptocurrency by emphasizing that in order to use Facebook’s Calibra digital wallet you would need to create a new account and use a government-issued ID to confirm your identity. He said Facebook believes this form of authentication will deter criminals from using the currency for nefarious purposes., “The way that we think about protecting the integrity of the network against money laundering, criminal activity and terrorism funding is by moving a lot of cash transactions into the digital world. Cash transactions are where most crimes happen,” he said. “The way we are applying anti-money-laundering programs as far as the Calibra wallet is concerned, we will have strong identity protections.”, Trump tweeted on Thursday that he is “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.“ He added, “Facebook Libra's ‘virtual currency’ will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National and International.”, Senators also chastised Facebook for failing to prevent misuse of consumer data in the past, included its admission last year that a political-ad-targeting firm had improperly gained access to more than 87 million users. “Facebook has demonstrated through scandal after scandal that it doesn’t deserve our trust. It should be treated like the profit-seeking corporation it is, just like any other company,” said Senator Sherrod Brown (D- Ohio)., He cited other privacy breaches, such as the millions of fake posts spread by a Russian propaganda firm during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Now Facebook asks people to trust them with their hard-earned paychecks. It takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance to look at that track record and think, ‘You know, really what we really ought to do next? Let’s run our own bank and our own for-profit version of the Federal Reserve. Let’s do it for the whole world.’”, Facebook plans to make money from Libra eventually, but the company has no immediate plans to use transaction data for advertising purposes. Answering questions about the long-term opportunity for Facebook, Marcus said, “It’s the ability for the 90 million small businesses on Facebook to transact with one another. And if there’s more commerce, there will be more advertising revenue for Facebook. More commercial activity on Facebook equals more money for Facebook.”, I'm an associate editor at Forbes covering Facebook and social media. I previously worked as an editor for Popular Science, Gizmodo, and Mashable leading investigations\", 'David Marcus , Facebook wants forgiveness. And to earn that forgiveness, the social media giant that was accused of allowing its users\\' personal data to be used by the controversial political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica has an uncanny plan. It’s going to use cryptocurrency, which was originally popularized as a way to anonymously buy drugs, to connect people without bank accounts to the global economy. That, and it will likely have to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the alleged privacy violations., The secret to this seemingly impossible task is that Facebook and the other companies in the nonprofit Libra Association have promised that every libra will be backed by stable assets, almost certainly including the U.S. dollar and government treasury bonds. While some central banks, like the Bank of England, have already reacted positively to the news their currency could be locked up in accounts held by private companies, the U.S. Federal Reserve has expressed concerns. President Donald Trump has called for the companies to get a banking charter, and multiple members of Congress have asked for a moratorium on development of the cryptocurrency until more is known., “Clearly we made mistakes in the past, and it’s a top priority for Mark Zuckerberg and the rest the leadership team to really address this,” says Marcus, who previously served as a board member for cryptocurrency startup Coinbase. “And as far as I’m concerned I see libra as an opportunity to demonstrate that we have learned and we are a different company now than we were.”, Forbes, While Marcus’ submitted comments call such privacy a “top priority” for the Libra Association, he adds that the ultimate regulator in charge is not even in the U.S., since to the nonprofit organization\\'s headquarters are in Geneva. “For the purposes of data and privacy protections, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) will be the Libra Association’s privacy regulator,” his notes read. , Regarding the project’s stance on privacy, Marcus says the Libra Association “cannot, and will not, monetize data on the blockchain,” though he is notably silent on how Calibra, the Facebook-owned wallet for buying, holding and storing cryptocurrency will use or not use customer data, saying only that “Calibra customers’ account and financial information will not be shared with Facebook” and leaving the door open for other possible uses., “As a consumer, no matter which wallet you choose, you’re going to get the benefit of the scale of the network,” says Marcus. “And for that reason we really need to earn consumers’ trust if we want to have a fighting chance.” Further competition will likely come from fellow fiat-backed stablecoins like Circle’s USD Coin and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’s Gemini Dollar, which also already have live products, while MakerDao and soon-to-be launched Celo offer similar stability without fiat currency at all., The second misunderstanding Marcus hopes to clarify to Congress is that critics, he says, have inaccurately portrayed libra as a weakening of central bank monetary supply controls, especially the ability to buy back government bonds as a way to increase demand for a currency. Since the Libra Association is committed to a 1:1 pairing of the value of currency, bonds and other assets stored in banks around the world with the value of the libra cryptocurrency in circulation, Marcus says monetary supply controls won’t be impacted. Should a central bank seek to buy back treasury bonds owned by the association, the association could compensate for that by purchasing other assets in different jurisdictions., “The Libra Association has no ability to create more libra than there are corresponding value in reserve. There’s no way to print money,” says Marcus. “The monetary policy of the assets that are contained in the basket gets transferred as a unit of digital currency that represents the underlying asset.” , Marcus sounds prepared for the long haul. “We will have to not only make very strong commitments when it comes to serving our customers,\" he says. “But we will have to live up to them for a very long period of time.”, I report on how blockchain and cryptocurrencies are being adopted by enterprises and the broader business community.

France is imposing a new digital tax targeting Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. , As with all corporate taxes, there is a widespread misunderstanding as to who actually pays the tax. Since in order to stay in business, customers have to cover all of a company's costs -- including taxes -- it is customers who ultimately pay the taxes., The French estimate that the new tax will yield 500 million euros a year. That may be so, but it will not reduce these companies' profits, they are merely the tax collectors., This does not mean these companies will be unscathed. There will be unintended but predictable side effects., Apple and Amazon will be easier to compete with within France at least until their competitors grow big enough to be subject to the tax. Still, I'd bet on Apple and Amazon even if their competitors have a 3% tax advantage., No one ever bought an Apple product because it was the cheapest alternative. And, with all the shenanigans that can occur when you buy things over the internet, Amazon's A to Z Guarantee is a good reason for the French to continue to shop on Amazon even if competitors prices are slightly lower., In addition, the companies that compete with Amazon and Apple may not hold their prices constant. Instead, they could raise their prices by 3%, but since they are not subject to the tax, they will just keep the money., Since Google and Facebook get their revenue from selling ads, the new tax makes it that much harder for a French company to win an auction for ad space on either platform. In fact, in every case where a French company won the bidding for an ad slot, there was a second-place bidder not far behind., If Google and Facebook simply refused to sell ads to French companies (so as not to trigger the tax), the second-place bidder would take the ad space at a not very much lower price. The net effect of the tax would then be to make French companies that sell products to Google and Facebook users less competitive., France has every right to impose taxes on activity within its borders as it sees fit. But this is not going to work out as they expect. However, if enough people think the new tax is a huge setback for Google, Apple, Facebook, or Amazon, we might see the stocks fall enough to give investors some great entry points., I am the CEO and founder of Marketocracy, Inc.,and portfolio manager at Marketocracy Capital Management, LLC.

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg, Facebook previously announced plans for launching a new cryptocurrency, Libra. The company didn’t, however, discuss how this new digital currency could completely change and shake up the banking and financial establishment. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg downplayed the new currency, claiming that it will be governed by a regulatory body in Switzerland and has a number of well respected participating institutions behind it. , Many doubt his assertions and believe that this is a power play to further grow his company and its span of control. If the billions of people who use Facebook decided to conduct transactions with Libra, it would jeopardize the United States and other country’s currencies and financial systems. While lightly covered, having one extremely powerful company control the flow of money, U.S. currency could suffer serious repercussions. Politicians slowly awakened to this danger and demanded that Facebook executives meet with congress.  , It seems that Democrats and Republicans alike finally agree on something—the threat Facebook\\'s new currency will have on the country. Tuesday, Facebook found itself once again under fire from Congress. The Senate Banking Committee grilled Facebook executive David Marcus—as CEO Mark Zuckerburg smartly avoided a return trip to the woodshed—concerning the company’s plan to launch its digital currency., The members of Congress did not look fondly on Facebook’s new initiative. Senator Sherrod Brown openly professed his displeasure and claimed that “through scandal after scandal...it doesn\\'t deserve our trust.\" Brown said, \"We\\'d be crazy to give them a chance to let them experiment with people\\'s bank accounts.\" He further added that it was \"delusional\" for customers to trust Facebook with their \"hard-earned\" money.  Other senators shared their concerns. \"I don\\'t trust you guys,\" said Republican Senator Martha McSally. \"Instead of cleaning up your house, you are launching into a new business model,\" she complained. , Marcus, who was formerly a high-ranking executive at PayPal, tried—without much success—to get Congress on his side. He promised that Facebook would not begin offering Libra until important regulatory issues are dealt with. , U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has affirmed that he is uncomfortable with Libra. Mnuchin stated that Libra “could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers” and it was a “national security issue.” He said, “Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity, like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human trafficking.”  , I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity...., When you have the president, secretary of the treasury, Fed chairman, Republicans and Democrats all agreeing on something, you know they are scared—and their fear is justified. How do you stop a company that\\'s a money-making machine, recently paid a $5 billion fine like it\\'s a parking ticket to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, consistently ignored privacy concerns of its users, allowed the spread of Russion disinformation, accused of stifling free speech on its platform, chastised by Congress and still pushes ahead without remorse, humility or apologies? , The crypto market will explode to the upside. Wealth for holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will soar. Jobs will be created to deal with the incredible growth. In particular, thousands of compliance, legal, risk, audit and regulatory positions will be created to watch over this new rapidly changing sector. Meanwhile, more jobs will be cut at traditional banks, as there will be a race toward moving away from them and toward FinTech-type companies. , Facebook could expand upon its currency and become one of the largest banking institutions overnight. It would be hard for giants, such as J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, to compete with a platform that has literally billions of users each day. Facebook knows every move their members make and will certainly use it to the company’s advantage. The entire business landscape could dramatically change. Those who will be part of the Libra and cryptocurrency team will enjoy money, power and opportunities.

There is an emerging field in steganography, which will continue to be a problem and will be much harder if not impossible to spot.\", And that, for many, remains the real issue., I am the Founder/CEO of Digital Barriers, providing surveillance solutions to defense, security and law enforcement agencies worldwide. Contact me at zakd@me.com.', \"The Federal Trade Commission reached a $5 billion settlement with Facebook. (Photo by LOIC VENANCE / AFP / Getty Images) , The settlement dwarfs the FTC’s largest penalty to date against a tech company over privacy issues, a record formerly held by the $22.5 million settlement reached with Google in 2012. It also brings U.S. regulators into the same realm as the E.U., which has levied billions of dollars in fines against major tech companies in the recent past. , Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. , Facebook’s stock price surged to its highest price in nearly a year following reports of the fine. One silver lining for investors: The settlement represents less than a quarter of Facebook’s annual profit and does not require Facebook to break up its other products, Instagram and WhatsApp., The battle between Facebook and U.S. regulators started in March 2018 when the FTC opened an investigation into Facebook’s privacy practices after the social network admitted political ad targeting firm Cambridge Analytica acquired detailed personal information of more than 87 million Facebook users through an academic researcher. The incident sparked a global debate about Facebook’s privacy practices — and raised more concern when it was revealed that Facebook knew about the privacy issue as early as 2015.,  CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed to treat users’ data with more care after the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Yet concerns about Facebook’s handling of the personal information of its 2 billion-plus users haven’t dissipated. Researchers in April discovered that troves of user information were inadvertently posted in plain text on a public Amazon cloud server, highlighting the wide distribution of Facebook user data., I'm an associate editor at Forbes covering Facebook and social media. I previously worked as an editor for Popular Science, Gizmodo, and Mashable leading investigations\", 'Riders in the 2019 Pan-Mass Challenge are increasingly using Facebook\\'s peer-to-peer fundraising tools to raise money for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. , In 2018, PMC riders were able to use Facebook\\'s peer-to-peer fundraising tools for the first time, raising $51,000. But in 2019, improvements to the Facebook integration have led to a dramatic uptick in peer-to-peer donations: more than $1.2 million and counting, an increase of more than 2,300%., “Since starting the PMC in 1980, we’ve worked to be innovative and lead on fundraising trends,” said Billy Starr, PMC Founder and Executive Director. “We were a pioneer of athletic fundraising and one of the first nonprofits to implement online peer-to-peer giving in 2000, but we continue to look for new ways to raise the bar as we grow.\", \"Our 100 percent pass-through rate is incredibly important to us and our community, which means each year we need to proactively reach new donors to ensure we’re able to maintain it,\" Starr added. \"As we approach our 40th ride, integrating further with Facebook was a natural progression and it has paid off in dividends – nearly 50% of the 16,000+ Facebook donors are giving to the PMC for the first time.”, To make it easier for people and communities to raise money on Facebook, Facebook\\'s free tools to help people collect donations and enable supporters to fundraise for nonprofits. Through Donate buttons on Pages, posts, and videos to nonprofit and birthday fundraisers, and the Fundraiser API, people can directly support the organizations they are passionate about., Nonprofits using Facebook’s payment platform to process donations pay no fee — 100% of the donations go to the charity., The 40th Annual Pan-Mass Challenge will take place on Aug. 3 &amp; 4 in Massachusetts., “The PMC is made up of a tight-knit group of 10,000+ riders and volunteers from around the world that have become family and return year after year to fundraise. When you’re looking to raise $60 million for cancer research through a single event, connections are key,” said Bill Alfano, PMC Director of Marketing and Sponsorship. “Facebook’s Fundraiser API allows our riders to reach friends, family, even acquaintances that they may not have otherwise asked for support. It allows for easy sharing across networks and exponentially increases their ability to solicit donations.”, Facebook itself points to PMC as a leader in its vision to increase peer-to-peer fundraising around the world., “Our Fundraiser API tool is designed to make giving easy and efficient. The Pan-Mass Challenge case is a perfect example of the tool’s potential – it’s incredible to see an already thriving athletic fundraiser be taken to new heights by simply providing their community a streamlined way to raise money,” said Kendra Sinclair, Strategic Partner Manager on Facebook’s Social Impact team. “The success is remarkable – in just over one month, the PMC has not only dramatically increased its fundraising for cancer through Facebook compared to past years, but more importantly, they are reaching new donors that may not have otherwise given to the cause.”, According to PMC, athletic fundraisers overall experienced a 2.7% decline in donations in 2018. But PMC has seen the opposite effect, crediting their forward-thinking approach to social media over the years. , I am an independent, award-winning mobile storyteller with experience working with nonprofit organizations in all 50 states.

Perhaps, the crisp Swiss air will inspire the various delegates — 27 companies have announced partnerships with Facebook — to firm up their nonbinding agreements. Or, maybe the scrutiny that Facebook has received, the criticism coming from governments and techies, and the doubts expressed by cryptocurrency experts will drive some companies to withdraw. As enthusiastic as I personally am about cryptocurrency and its potential to change the world for the better, the things that I have read, watched, and discussed since the Libra news broke out have left me suspicious about Facebook’s goals and methods. I know that I’m not the only one who has doubts., In just 15 years of operation, Facebook has acquired over two billion users. Millions of people who don’t use the flagship product nonetheless have daily interactions with the company, which owns both WhatsApp and Instagram. Given the meteoric pace of Facebook’s rise, it is not surprising that the company’s plans tend to be ambitious and its implementations usually swift. In the case of Libra, however, Facebook may have attempted too much too quickly., Libra won’t link its valuation to a preexisting “fiat” currency issued by a government, and Facebook wants its cryptocurrency to be global. Does that sound like any other cryptocurrency? If you said that it sounds just like Bitcoin, the first and still the most trusted cryptocurrency, you’d be entirely correct. Bitcoin has existed for over a decade, and even those who prefer other currencies at least acknowledge the strength of the Bitcoin community and the trustworthiness of the currency’s algorithms. Banks, corporations, and governments have been afraid of cryptocurrencies for years, and, for the majority of them, it was too late to get involved to fully capitalize on the inevitable decentralized payment adoption. What if leading corporates joined forces to create the only feasible way to compete with Bitcoin? I doubt very much that we would see them back out, in that instance., I am the CEO of Propy, a Silicon Valley proptech company revolutionizing home purchasing via blockchain. An award-winning real estate developer, software engineer, and a...', '2017 VCG, It might be time for poker players to cash in their chips after Facebook and Carnegie Mellon researchers created an artificial intelligence (AI) bot that can beat top human professionals in six-player no-limit Texas hold\\'em poker, the most popular form of the card game., Poker has long been regarded as a \"grand challenge\" in the field of AI. The fact that the game involves hidden information—you don’t know your opponents’ cards—means that success requires bluffing and other tactics that don\\'t apply to many other games. This has made poker resistant to AI techniques that have produced breakthroughs in other games. Researchers have been able to develop AIs that can beat one other player at no-limit Texas hold\\'em poker, but multiplayer has been too difficult to crack. , Pluribus mastered multiplayer Texas hold\\'em by playing against previous versions of itself. This \"self-play\" learning method means that it was not fed any data from humans and it did not observe games played by other AI systems either.    , \"The AI starts from scratch by playing randomly and gradually improves as it determines which actions and which probability distribution over those actions lead to better outcomes against earlier versions of its strategy,\" Brown and Sandholm write in their paper. This strategy has been used before. For example, Google DeepMind used it to crack Go and OpenAI used it to master Dota 2. , Journalist  Cade Metz (L) and Facebook\\'s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun (R). , AI researchers have been using games as a testbed for their AI agents for decades and in recent years there have been a number of breakthroughs thanks to advances in computing, better data sets, and more sophisticated AI techniques. Tech giants are investing heavily into the space in the hope that gaming breakthroughs will lead to breakthroughs in other areas such as healthcare, science, and energy. , \"These innovations have important implications beyond poker, because two-player zero-sum interactions (in which one player wins and one player loses) are common in recreational games, but they are very rare in real life,\" write the researchers in a blog post. \"Real-world scenarios—such as bidding in an online auction or navigating traffic—typically involve multiple actors.\", Pluribus beat top-ranked professional players in both a five AIs plus one human player format and a one AI plus five professionals format. Among the professionals were Chris Ferguson, the World Series of Poker champion, and Darren Elias, an American pro who holds the record for winning the most World Poker Tour titles. , There was no money at stake but the researchers claim that if each chip was worth a dollar, Pluribus would have won an average of about $5 per hand and would have made about $1,000 per hour playing against five humans. , Pluribus is a supercharged version of another AI bot called Libratus, which beat human pros in two-player Texas hold’em games in 2017.  , Unlike Libratus, Pluribus contains a new online search algorithm that can evaluate its options by searching a few moves ahead, as well as faster self-play algorithms. , The combination of these two factors made it possible to train Pluribus using relatively little processing power and memory. The researchers say they required just $150 worth of cloud computing resources. \"This efficiency stands in stark contrast to other recent AI milestone projects, which required the equivalent of millions of dollars’ worth of computing resources to train,\" they write. , \"Pluribus is a very hard opponent to play against,\" said Ferguson. \"It’s really hard to pin him down on any kind of hand. He’s also very good at making thin value bets on the river and extracting value out of his good hands.\", Elias added that Pluribus\\'s main strength is its ability to use mixed strategies, which is what humans try to do. , \"It’s a matter of execution for humans–to do this in a perfectly random way and to do so consistently,\" he says. \"Most people just can’t. The bot wasn’t just playing against some middle of the road pros. It was playing some of the best players in the world.\", While Pluribus might send a shiver down the spine of professional poker players that make a living from winning online tournaments, they don\\'t need to worry about coming up against Pluribus in their next match. , I\\'m a Staff Writer covering tech in Europe. Previously, I was a News Editor for Business Insider Australia, and prior to that I was a Senior Technology Reporter for Busi...', 'Think of this mathematics. A $59 fine per 84,000,000 Facebook user that Cambridge Analytica played with data from. It is not confirmed yet, but the FTC has agreed a $5bn fine for Facebook, and its involvement with the collection and analysis of approximately 84,000,000 Facebook accounts information by Cambridge Analytica. , There is always going to be a dispute about was it a process of illicit collection, inappropriate analysis and usage. But the elongated journey to get to this point is a bad week for corporations playing the wild, wild, west with data from their customers. Look at British Airways this week in the UK and Marriott too in the UK. $130M fine for Marriott and $230M for British Airways. $350m+ in a week, $5.5bn in total. These fines may not sound significant, but in one week it is equal to the total services exports from the US to Belgium in 2017, or the potential value of the digital signature market by 2025, or the size of the Pacemaker market in 2017. Maybe silly comparisons, but not small ones. We are one week into this and more will come as governing bodies develop an appetite to copy what happened this week. , Network Big Data Transfer, We cannot escape a very basic truth that our data has value. Now we need to all respect that., Everybody knows that we are entering an age where new things from bitcoin to the fractional and combined values of your data (physical and digital) must have some value because Google and Facebook make a pile of money from mining it and putting it all together for advertisers. Take the data away and what do these and other media brands have assets? , So, what is going wrong to take for us to get this, right? There is a deep lack of understanding about what data is. It is, in effect, a currency, a two-day promise from user to company and from company to user about respecting what the exchange of it means. , Even in 1086, users understood the interchange value of data. William, the Conqueror, got it., Users are more than happy to share something if it helps build long-term value for them. Go back to the original census conducted by William I in England. The Doomsday Book, or Liber de Wintonia, in 1086. There weren’t major riots; people generally did not hide the basics and recognized that sharing knowledge might help them. This is part of what we see in the idea of the wisdom of crowds. People get it, so stop hiding the potential value and show customers and consumers what you are doing with their data. 8 point legal riders do not count. Why do we fail to get nearly a thousand years later? , Information, data is far more powerful when shared., The best data is usable in multiple ways for both the business and the consumer. Consumers want to do a better job of consuming and experiencing. Why not share insights with them. For example, the most enjoyable content, the best times to come to a restaurant or a website, what people like them do at a deep level. Educated consumers are better consumers than blind consumers. CEO’s should recognize the power of great data in their consumer’s hands is possibly better than the power of it in their hands. Once people see the value to the data they give, think about how much more they will share with you going forward? , I hate the term data mining. Data is a currency not a mined mineral, The heading probably says it all. The great value of data is that it is living currency. Where you get it from, how you use it, how it evolves is more like a currency than a raw mineral. You are not going to throw away minerals like gold, but you might throw away pieces of data. Mining also tends to infer extraction and not an application. CEO’s need to think only about the application. The fines we saw this week are the tip of the iceberg if your company doesn’t see data in the three dimensions discussed above. Protecting information is really tough, every Chief Security Officer will tell you that. More importantly though if your philosophy is not two way (us and the customer), it will be far too easy to slip into the errors these three brands fell into because these types of decisions about how to use data is handled below the water level like the nine-tenths of an iceberg., I am the bestselling (Wall Street Journal and Amazon) author of the book, The Digital Helix, about the DNA of successful digital transformation traits of the 28% of corp..., The Thought Leadership section presents thought leadership content and original research from the Thought Leadership research division of Forbes Media.

For marketers building retargeting campaigns and lookalike campaigns, does this trigger a big yawn or a big shift?, “I do not believe a majority of FB users will take advantage of the ‘clear history’ tool,” says Mari Connor, owner of Marigold Marketing Group, a full-service Facebook ads agency., “Any devaluation of the custom audiences will be minimal,” says Connor., “While the statement Facebook is making by adding a ‘clear history’ tool is significant, and the right move to make after the Cambridge Analytica scandal was exposed in 2018, I don't believe it will be as significant as some will assume., “Google users currently have the ability to easily ‘clear’ their search history, browser history and cookies on their internet browser(s) any time they wish, but many still do not think, remember, or care to do so.”, The capability will let members delete data the social network collects from apps and websites and apps outside of Facebook. This data will no longer be available for marketers to build campaigns., Adjustments Afoot In Campaign Strategy, “Marketers will have to adjust their advertising tactics to be less granular in their use of retargeting audiences to ensure they still have scale,” says Melianthe Kines, director, paid social strategy at iQuanti., “Retargeting has been the proverbial low-hanging fruit for years, so this may push advertisers to reach a little higher and more creatively to find audiences, at least on Facebook and its family of apps. And it’s quite likely that the other social platforms will follow suit after monitoring how the move affects Facebook.”, New Tactics, New Workarounds, “Marketers and businesses alike can still use the FB ad tool,” says Connor. “They can leverage and access portions of their segmented email and customer list members, FB Page or FB Post engagers, and FB video viewers, all of whom can be retargeted with relevant and helpful offers through FB ads., Moving Forward With The Facebook Clear History Tool, Connor concurs. “I assume the percentage of users who leverage the “clear history’ tool on a regular basis will be in the minority, and not the majority.”, Minus strategy marketing staggers.
