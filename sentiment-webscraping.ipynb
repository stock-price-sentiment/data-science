      "[<p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">For decades, computer programmers have been trying to beat multiplayer games by finding reliable patterns in data.</p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smart bearded person in a classic gray suit is playing poker at casino in smoke sitting at the table with chips and cards on it . He is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand and looking away. Gambling addiction. Sincere emotions and entertainment concept.</p>, <p>This is a big step forward for data science. It shows where the world is headed.</p>, <p>Collecting and understanding data is key.</p>, <p>There have been big strides in programs mastering board games like checkers and chess. A super AI called AlphaGo, a prototype from Google Mind, even conquered Go, an extremely complex Chinese strategy game. It trounced Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world, in a widely publicized match.</p>, <p>Many software developers assumed Go was unassailable given the state of AI development.</p>, <p>But AlphaGo caught Sedol off-guard. Developed by playing against itself millions of times, the software learned to be unpredictable. In the end, Sedol couldn’t determine why moves were being made.</p>, <p>Pluribus, the Facebook and CMU collaboration, leans hard on being unpredictable. It makes sense.</p>, <p>Whereas checkers, chess and even Go are limited to two players, poker traditionally involves more, creating a significant challenge for an AI. Exploiting the weaknesses of a single player would not be enough. Pluribus was designed to take on five world-class opponents simultaneously.</p>, <p>With six players, six hands of cards, the bets, and the sheer multitude of possible outcomes, the game would have overwhelmed even the most robust supercomputer. Pluribus needed a reliable edge.</p>, <p>The edge researchers used was counterfactual regret minimization.</p>, <p>The big idea: During training, as Pluribus played against itself, the AI noted the outcome of games given all of the variables. Then, the software systematically played game after game, altering a variable each time.</p>, <p>Pluribus learned that some moves, even crazy ones, were winners in defined circumstances. Flummoxed players, for example, would fold. And that is the key.</p>, <p>We humans fidget nervously; we behave predictably when we are anxious. Professional poker players can spot these tells a mile away. Pluribus does not really play to its opponents’ weaknesses. It plays to its inherent strength — it has no tell. It is completely unpredictable.</p>, <p>The proof is in the gameplay.</p>, <p>Researchers set Pluribus up against world-class professional poker players, including Jimmy Chou, Seth Daniels, Michael Gagliano, Sean Ruane and Jacob Toole. In 10,000 hands of Texas Hold ‘Em with five other players, Pluribus won chips consistently, along with high praise from its human competitors.</p>, <p>Ruane even marveled at its relentless consistency.</p>, <p>Public cloud infrastructure is democratizing computer processing and data storage. And Software-as-a-Service companies are building bolt-on applications to turn mountains of corporate data into actionable insights.</p>, <p>It was a bold pitch, but Stoecker was on to something bigger — digital transformation.</p>, <p>Sales in the first quarter, which ended March 31, were $76 million, a 51% increase year over year. Gross profits were $68 million, and cash flow was $16 million. The company logged 2018 sales of $253 million, up 92.6% vs.  2017.</p>, <p>The business is growing fast and that is being reflected in the share price. Alteryx shares are up 104% this year, and 209% during the past 12 months.</p>, <p>Shares trade at 166x forward earnings and 26x sales. This stock is not cheap, but it’s the right stock for this era of new business models built with data.</p>, <p>Growth investors should consider buying Alteryx into bouts of weakness.</p>, <p>I am an  investment adviser, trader, columnist and author based in Seattle.

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: Getty</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\"><span>The Achilles’ heel of crypto is security. This is ironic because the whole thing about crypto is security and the safety it brings to things, especially information.</span></p>, <p><span>However, crypto has been beset on all sides by scammers. Whether it is disappearing exchanges, scam initial coin offerings, robbers, hackers, fake investment schemes or goings on in the dark web, crypto has a massive crime problem.</span></p>, <p><span>Where there are resources there are predators, so this should not be a surprise.</span></p>, <p><span>Facebook’s Libra project recently being dragged to congress for hearings to explain itself is causing a stir even while it now seems that it will be some time before it goes live. A global private sector currency with a vast captive audience has made quite a few government money folks’ eyes bug out. Libra is a monetary ‘Mars attack.’ It is also an inevitable one, bound to be followed by many large organizations in search of printing their own money.</span></p>, <p><span>The flip side of the criminal onslaught is the huge interest that bitcoin and other cryptos garner in the general populations. You can’t be interviewed as a public figure without someone popping a bitcoin question at you. It’s as if every financial and political figure was asked about the future and stock price of Netflix, a company with a similar market cap to bitcoin. This interest is not going away and will be a driver for the whole industry in the same way that bottom up interest in being online drove the take up of the internet and WWW.</span></p>, <p><span>So it is not surprising that this week finds the first flush of libra crypto scammers moving in to steal money from the unwary.</span></p>, <p><span>At least one criminal outfit has advertised access to libra on Facebook this week inviting \"expressions of interest in libra.\" Anyone who registered for that would then get hit up by a boiler room.</span></p>, <p><span>The curious user reported the following:</span></p>, <p><span>“Today I get a call from a boiler room saying they are Facebook in Switzerland and wanting me to set up an account so I can trade. Apparently, I don’t need to worry if I have not done it before; a broker could do it for me. They were going to give $300 to start with to trade implying this was $300 of libra.”</span></p>, <p><span>This is all reminiscent of the criminals who worked in \"binary bets\" a simple bilk where if the vicious gambling product didn’t get you, then the company would by simply not paying your money back, which was vastly more likely to be what you had left after losses than winnings. This was a very lucrative racket for some very shady people creating such a pestilence that the EU and many other jurisdictions shut down the basis of the swindle, the trading of binary bets. </span></p>, <p><span>If you see anything like this in future, simply ignore it. The Libra scams have begun and there will be a world more of them coming our way.</span></p>, <p><span>The question I really want answered is, how on earth did this outfit get to advertise on Facebook? Having been pummeled for a $5 billion fine for not keeping its users safe, here is a blatant example of Facebook putting its users at risk, by enabling a shady, unregulated and likely criminal organization to prey on its users.</span></p>, <p><span>It’s unlikely that this crypto ad showed up on this user’s Facebook without there being a filter for him being a trader, crypto enthusiast or investor. Even if Facebook didn’t specifically target him for this outfit, how could it even get onto the platform at all?</span></p>, <p><span>If Facebook is going to launch Libra, it needs to care about these things and start locking out the obvious predators from its estate. How hard can it be to spot a financial bucket shop trying to sell your own unreleased crypto currency?</span></p>, <p><span>Really hard if you don’t give a wooden nickel.</span></p>, <p><a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\"><em data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\">Forbes Special Offer: Be among the first to get important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential.

In his letter, he asks for information in a number of areas about the groups and the internal investigation, and notes that the CBP did not honor his request for a briefing on the matter.</p>, <p>Spokesmen for the CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>, <p>In a statement, a Facebook spokesman said the company has \"been in regular contact with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee and will continue to work with the committee to lawfully obtain the information it is seeking.\"</p>, <p>\"We are also continuing to cooperate with federal authorities,\" the spokesman added.</p>, <p>ProPublica noted that the CBP posts, made in secret Facebook groups known as \"I'm 10-15\" and \"The Real CBP Nation\" come as \"the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces.\"</p>, <p>Cummings has issued an expansive data request to CBP, calling for the agency to turn over every piece of content from the secret Facebook groups dating to Jan. 20, 2017, along with identifying information about the thousands of current and former CBP employees who were members of the groups.</p>, <p>He is also seeking the name, position and employment status of every employee who is under investigation.</p>, <p>Cummings further asks the CBP to comply with his request for a briefing on the matter by Aug. 7, 2019.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...\">Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...</p>]\n",

This problem of human latency is a key hurdle for tech giants like Google and Facebook that are looking for new ways to grow by shoving ever-more petabytes of data into our brains, and vice versa. </p>, <p>As part of their effort, Facebook has been funding a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) working to help patients with neurological damage to speak again by detecting imagined speech in real time. </p>, <p> Facebook hopes the work of the UCSF team will serve as a proof of concept to inform the development of the non-invasive wearable it dreams of pairing with AR glasses.</p>, <p> \"If we can now measure signals in the brain via implantable devices, then we can transmit those signals outside of the brain.\"</p>, <p>Facebook thinks that a promising way to make the leap from \"reading minds\" via wired electrodes to a wireless system is by measuring changes in oxygen levels in the brain using infrared light similar to a pulse oximeter at a doctor's office. </p>, <p>\"This could work, though I am afraid that the rates (timing) of oxygenation processes are much lower than the actual rate at which speech is produced,\" Josep Jornet, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, told me. \"Certainly more work is needed, but this is what research is about and should be promoted.\"</p>, <p>Todd Richmond, an IEEE member and Director of the Tech and Narrative Lab at the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica says \"having a viable capability in the lab\" to wirelessly send brain signals to a computer could be less than five years away.</p>, <p> \"It will likely take longer to move from the lab to commercial deployment for a variety of reasons,\" he adds.</p>, <p>Richmond thinks the first hurdles will be solving technical problems to make the system lighter, smaller, faster and essentially, more practical. Next comes the process of refining the user experience to make brain interfaces a necessity rather than a novelty. </p>, <p> \"The third set of developments will be around improving accuracy, efficacy, and safety,\" he explains. \"Like any consumer product, we’ll need to sort out what agencies are looking at what aspects of how devices impact humans, both individually and from a societal level.\"</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I've covered science, technology, the environment and politics for outlets including CNET, PC World, BYTE, Wired, AOL and NPR.

      "[<p class=\"color-body light-text\">SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 30: The Portal by Facebook is displayed during the F8 Facebook Developers conference on April 30, 2019 in San Jose, California. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered the opening keynote to the FB Developer conference</p>, <p>Set to launch this Fall, Catalina is equally unlikely to thrill consumers that are on the verge of recession but more so, who don't trust you. Facebook should be wary of spending so much time, money and effort building products that people don't want when the one you are famous for is on fire in multiple areas. What should Facebook do to build trust? Change your ways would be a smart play - even just a little. Facebook doesn't seem to want to as that may halt the money printing presses, the big blue app keeps working 24/7. </p>, <p>Facebook doesn't need to decide whether they want to be a force for good and have a product that they want people to use not feel they have to use. The actions of the company have shown the side they pick time and time again. Shareholders. Doing so makes Facebook a good business but not a good company. The issue ahead of Facebook becomes less if people will ever trust Facebook again, that ship has sailed unless they find a new business model. Instead, the issue will likely surround if Facebook kills or buys everything that rises up against it. Only here will the EU and FTC be of use in helping (read: force) Facebook to change its ways.</p>, <p>Facebook needs people to buy back into it but without changing the MO of the company this isn't going to happen and eventually the head will eat the tail. Oculus Quest, Portal and other technology that Facebook makes are good products but the flesh is weak. Fix that and you have a strong play. </p>]\n",

It also agrees to produce quarterly compliance reports and add an independent board committee to oversee its privacy practices.</p>, <p>But that doesn't go nearly far enough, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy counsel at the digital rights group Public Knowledge.</p>, <p>\"Under this settlement, Facebook does not have to meaningfully change how it collects and uses your data. Facebook retains complete control over when to share your data outside of Facebook, as long as the company complies with the privacy policy that it gets to write,\" Slaiman said.</p>, <p>The agreement does nothing to address the competitive advantages that Facebook enjoys by virtue of its size and reach, and could even insulate the company from further enforcement actions, she argues.</p>, <p>\"While the settlement does require additional auditing processes and reporting requirements as well as a very large fine, the settlement is weak given the repeated violations and the severity of the harm,\" Slaiman said. \"We must pass new and more effective privacy laws, as well as broader platform regulation aimed at improving competition in the sector so that consumers can more easily switch to an alternative product if they are not happy.\"</p>, <p>Not all of the criticisms of the settlement came from consumer advocates who wanted the company to face tougher penalties.</p>, <p>At TechFreedom, a think tank with a libertarian bent, president Berin Szoka observed that $5 billion is no small penalty, even for Facebook, but while the company can rather easily afford it, \"who else could?\"</p>, <p>\"Nothing could do more to discourage competition with today's tech giants than the looming threat of such massive fines,\" Szoka said. \"Those cheering today's settlement as a victory against Big Tech should think twice about its long-term effects on those trying to dethrone Facebook.\"</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...\">Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...</p>]\n",

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Getty Images</p>, <p>The encryption debate is typically framed around the concept of an impenetrable link connecting two services whose communications the government wishes to monitor. The reality, of course, is that the security of that encryption link is entirely separate from the security of the devices it connects. The ability of encryption to shield a user’s communications rests upon the assumption that the sender and recipient’s devices are themselves secure, with the encrypted channel the only weak point.</p>, <p>After all, if either user’s device is compromised, unbreakable encryption is of little relevance.</p>, <p>This is why surveillance operations typically focus on compromising end devices, bypassing the encryption debate entirely. If a user’s cleartext keystrokes and screen captures can be streamed off their device in real-time, it matters little that they are eventually encrypted for transmission elsewhere.</p>, <p>Historically, compromising end devices was an expensive and complex process, powered by a cat-and-mouse game with hardware manufacturers and software vendors to find vulnerabilities that could be used to remotely install them and acquire the necessary device privileges.</p>, <p>Such efforts are hard to scale and the more devices that are compromised, the more likely the vulnerability is to be discovered and patched.</p>, <p>In Facebook’s vision, the actual end-to-end encryption client itself such as WhatsApp will include embedded content moderation and blacklist filtering algorithms. These algorithms will be continually updated from a central cloud service, but will run locally on the user’s device, scanning each cleartext message before it is sent and each encrypted message after it is decrypted.</p>, <p>Facebook’s model entirely bypasses the encryption debate by globalizing the current practice of compromising devices by building those encryption bypasses directly into the communications clients themselves and deploying what amounts to machine-based wiretaps to billions of users at once.</p>, <p>Asked the current status of this work and when it might be deployed in the production version of WhatsApp, a company spokesperson declined to comment.</p>, <p>Of course, Facebook’s efforts apply only to its own encryption clients, leaving criminals and terrorists to turn to other clients like Signal or their own bespoke clients they control the source code of.</p>, <p>The problem is that if Facebook’s model succeeds, it will only be a matter of time before device manufacturers and mobile operating system developers embed similar tools directly into devices themselves, making them impossible to escape. Embedding content scanning tools directly into phones would make it possible to scan all apps, including ones like Signal, effectively ending the era of encrypted communications.</p>, <p>Governments would soon use lawful court orders to require companies to build in custom filters of content they are concerned about and automatically notify them of violations, including sending a copy of the offending content.</p>, <p>Rather than grappling with how to defeat encryption, governments will simply be able to harness social media companies to perform their mass surveillance for them, sending them real-time alerts and copies of the decrypted content.</p>, <p>While some phone manufacturers could distinguish themselves by offering bespoke phones with custom operating systems that do not include such scanning, such devices are likely to be rare, used only by those who are willing to go to great lengths to escape government scrutiny and thus automatically drawing substantial attention to themselves. Over time, it is likely that many governments will simply pass laws banning the possession and use of such devices, much as many jurisdictions ban devices that help speeders escape traffic tickets.</p>, <p>In the end, encryption’s days are numbered and the world has Facebook to thank.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...\">Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...</p>]\n"

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Getty Images</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Silicon Valley has been a leading proponent of the idea of so-called “safe spaces” in colleges and businesses in which dedicated rooms are established where students and employees can go to get away from viewpoints, information and mentions that distress them or triggers past trauma. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, news relating to the new administration and its policies were a common refrain in the call for more safe spaces. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s social media platforms saturate those same vulnerable individuals with ceaseless political ads that are impossible to escape. Why don’t platforms like Facebook allow users to opt-out of political advertisements, creating digital safe spaces from content that triggers them?</p>, <p>In our ever more hyper-partisan world in which differing viewpoints and information that conflicts with one’s viewpoints and beliefs or which touches upon past traumatic experiences can lead to intense psychological trauma, so-called “safe spaces” have emerged in the academic and corporate world as a way to escape the traumas of the real world.</p>, <p>Despite their growing popularity, these physical rooms have no counterpart in the digital world.</p>, <p>Attempting to insulate oneself online from contrary viewpoints or information or from narratives that touch upon past traumatic experiences is next to impossible. By their very design social media platforms are constructed to flood their users with an endless stream of information that is algorithmically curated just for them, personalized to maximize their reaction. Given that outrage provokes a far more energetic (and thus monetizable) response than serenity, the more social media platforms learn about us, the more they surround us with an endless curated firehose of hate and horror that is personalized just for us.</p>, <p>Broadcast platforms like Twitter make it difficult to escape such content, since anyone can reach anyone else, yet even closed social networks like Facebook, in which connections are reciprocal, pose a growing challenge through their advertising.</p>, <p>On Facebook a user can carefully construct their social group to ensure it consists only of those who think and act exactly like themselves, creating a homogeneous echo chamber that entirely insulates them from the outside world.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, this echo chamber cannot protect them from advertisements.</p>, <p>Notably absent from this list are political advertisements. Political and issue advertisements frequently touch upon the rawest and most divisive societal fracture lines that are often what drive individuals to seek refuge within those physical safe spaces. An ad for a brand of soda or bath towels at the local supermarket are unlikely to trigger trauma in the average person. Political ads, by their very nature, are designed to prompt strong emotional responses along the fault lines that define the partisan world of politics.</p>, <p>Getting away from these ads can be nearly impossible. Today’s ads are so hyper-targeted and run in such vast quantities that no amount of clicking “don’t show me this ad” can stop the deluge, especially around election time.</p>, <p>A user who is triggered by any mention of a particular political candidate who is running for election in their district will find it effectively impossible to escape their barrage of campaign ads on Facebook. Every login will bring another stream of ads and the more that user attempts to avoid them, the more they are likely to see.</p>, <p>Even using Facebook’s advertising settings to manually remove every conceivable advertising selector and request that their interests not be used to show them ads will still likely end up being saturated by campaign ads. They are simply impossible to escape in today’s digital-first campaigning.</p>, <p>For a company like Facebook that has embraced the concept of safe spaces in the physical world, why does it not offer the digital equivalent on its platform, allowing its users to get away from political advertisements that cause them enormous emotional distress?</p>, <p>A company spokesperson confirmed the company’s commitment to safe spaces and noted that it offers meditation spaces and special rooms for its own employees as a form of “safe space” and that for employees that feel triggered at work, many are permitted to work from home to escape those triggers. The spokesperson also noted that the company has rolled out new policies this year governing its internal message boards and communications forums in an effort to make all employees comfortable.</p>, <p>Yet when asked why the company does not extend the same courtesy to offer the digital equivalent of such safe spaces to its two billion users to escape from advertisements that cause them deep distress or trauma and may even trigger hospitalization, the spokesperson said the company did not have comment.</p>, <p>Asked why the company does not at the very least allow users to request that political ads be displayed with a blurred overlay with a trigger warning that requires manually clicking to see the actual ad, the company again declined to comment.</p>, <p>This raises the question of why the company apparently does not believe that “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings” are a useful or important tool in today’s world for its users, despite extending such protections to its own employees. After all, if Facebook believed safe spaces were so important, it would roll them out on its own site by allowing users to protect themselves from triggering advertising content. Once again, the company declined to comment.</p>, <p>Asked whether the company believes it should be held legally, ethically or morally responsible if a user suffers emotional distress or hospitalization from encountering an advertisement that triggers them given that the company actively refuses to allow users to remove political advertisements from their Facebook experience, the company again declined to comment.</p>, <p>Given that Facebook does actively screen advertisements to ensure that they comply with its terms of service, it is not a neutral platform. It has a set of content standards and actively enforces these through moderation. This raises the question of how it would respond to the criticism that if it is actively enforcing content standards on its platform, it has a moral responsibility to provide a safe space on its platform that protects users from allowable content that triggers them. Again, the company declined to comment.</p>, <p>Of course, one could argue that the point of advertising is to allow users to be forcibly exposed to views and perspectives they might not otherwise consume. At the same time, there must be a balance between forcible exposure to unexpected content and forced exposure to unwanted content that causes immense distress.</p>, <p>On possibility would be to allow users to select the specific issues, political parties and candidates they would like to hear from, isolating them from issues and candidates that trigger them. Asked whether the company would consider offering such options, the company again declined to comment.</p>, <p>Putting this all together, despite endorsing the concept of safe spaces and providing them to its own employees, Facebook appears to have little interest in offering a digital equivalent to its two billion users that would allow them to shield themselves from the increasingly divisive political and issue ads that can cause them immense trauma and distress.</p>, <p>The company’s refusal to comment on any of these issues reminds us that for all its public statements, it has little interest in meaningful change that would impact its bottom line.</p>, <p>In the end, as long as political ads bring in revenue, it will be impossible to escape them.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...\">Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...</p>]\n"

After all, financial theory argues that all relevant information about stocks is instantly priced in. Therefore, as the late John Bogle argued so well, you're better off matching the market by buying a low-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund.</p>, <p>This comes to mind in considering the latest earnings reports from Tesla and Facebook. How so? Tesla's CEO Elon Musk excites all sorts of volatile emotions among his followers — love for the company's products and his heroic exploits and fear as every quarterly report induces agony about whether the company will make money or meet its production targets.</p>, <p>By contrast, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg does not produce such emotional volatility. Lacking Musk's charisma, he regularly outrages people when violating norms about selling peoples' Facebook activity to corporate and political interests. People keep getting their dopamine hits from the endless stream of likes on their Facebook posts and despite fines and threat of government interference, the company keeps on beating expectations when it reports quarterly results.</p>, <p>If you must buy an individual stock — buy one that passes the System 2 test rather than the one that excites your System 1. For example, buy Facebook and dump Tesla. (I have no financial interest in the securities mentioned in this post).</p>, <p>Meanwhile Tesla failed miserably when it comes to System 2 — losing money, burning through more cash and doing so in a way that fell short of investors' expectations. Tesla shares are down 15% in 2019 and have risen at a more impressive 32% average annual rate since their July 2010 IPO.</p>, <p>Facebook proved that government fines — such as the $5 billion FTC fine it's paying to settle the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal — and investigations are a minor cost of sustaining its expectations-beating, profitable growth. As it transitions from a business model based on advertising to News Feed to one based on advertising to Stories (of which it has 500 million users), Messenger and WhatsApp, it grew its top line and earnings more rapidly than expected. </p>, <p>But it has a long road ahead to meet its production targets for 2019. Tesla still expects to sell between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019 — mostly Model 3s — of which it delivered around 158,200 in the first half of 2019. It has to deliver \"more than 200,000 in the back half of the year to hit the low-end of its guidance,\" according to CNBC. </p>, <p>If you must buy individual stocks, Facebook is clearly the better bet — but if you like a good story, Musk's emotional ups and downs beat Zuckerberg's steady dopamine drip hands down.  </p>, <p><a class=\"color-link\" href=\"https:// http://bit.ly/32Nrsqq\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forbes Special Report: Picking the right investment opportunities is critical.

The potential for Facebook to become a super monopoly could be damaging to many - global domination of many markets by a single entity. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We only have to look back at the GFC to see what happens when banks become too big to fail.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like the game of Monopoly, are we taking a massive risk in rolling the die and going along with Libra only to play in Facebook’s favour? </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, that all depends on the playing abilities of its competition. </span></p>, <p><b>Playing The Chance Card </b></p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Monopoly</p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The oligopoly that has governed the world’s financial systems for centuries hasn’t really faced a threat to their market share, until now. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would make Facebook a massive centralised force, diminishing the power of nation state central banks. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There could be many upsides to this, such as empowering the unbanked, and sure, playing the Chance card can advance you in the game, but there’s always that risk of a lethal consequence. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And what if the central banks can’t rise to the challenge to keep things competitive? </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, there’s still one more opponent that could give Facebook a run for its money. </span></p>, <p><b>Advance To Go </b></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fluidity, a financial technology company based in Brooklyn, has proposed a new model and mechanism called the Tokenized Asset Portfolio (TAP) to allow real world assets to be pledged as collateral in decentralized finance.  </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would cover much of the functionality introduced by Libra, similarly a stablecoin and platform backed by real world assets such as US treasuries and high quality currencies.  </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MakerDao is the central bank of the new economy, and by providing infrastructure for automated and tailored leverage, we expect the surrounding economies to continue to grow at increasing rates,” said Fluidity co-founder and CEO Michael Oved.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By introducing real world assets to MCD through Tokenized Asset Portfolios, we are pushing forward our mission to connect legacy financial systems to decentralized finance, with the goal of making capital markets open and accessible.” </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the TAP is implemented, it is intended that more stable assets will be used to back Dai, allowing the two to look more similar. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The TAP is a potentially revolutionary new technology that allows borrowers to use their real world assets (like real estate or securities) as collateral for various blockchain-based lending applications, potentially unlocking a lower-cost and more automated source of capital with fewer intermediaries.  </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This  provides both individuals and industry participants with access to low-cost, permissionless credit from alternative blockchain funding sources. </span></p>, <p>The team is initially focusing on securities lending transactions, but soon plans to expand into other types of credit products, including commercial and residential mortgages.</p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To test this technology, this week a real world asset, U.S. Treasury securities, was pledged to a decentralized blockchain-based lending application, through the use of a TAP. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treasuries are one of the most liquid asset classes in the world, and now there is the ability to use them in decentralized finance, resulting in disintermediation, automation, and the potential for lower cost of capital.</span></p>, <p><b>Rolling The Dice </b></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MakerDao is part of the Decentralized Finance, or “DeFi” movement, which replicate conventional financial tools through sets of smart contracts — specifically on Ethereum. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain-based secondary markets, such as Kyber, Uniswap, and AirSwap, as well as lending platforms, such at MakerDao, Compound, and Nuo, have begun to form the backbone of these new capital markets. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of smart contracts allow transactions to be programmed, automated, and completed without middlemen.   </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ethos of DeFi is to reconstruct the world of banking in a way that’s completely different from before;

He is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand and looking away. Gambling addiction. Sincere emotions and entertainment concept., This is a big step forward for data science. It shows where the world is headed., Collecting and understanding data is key., There have been big strides in programs mastering board games like checkers and chess. A super AI called AlphaGo, a prototype from Google Mind, even conquered Go, an extremely complex Chinese strategy game. It trounced Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world, in a widely publicized match., Many software developers assumed Go was unassailable given the state of AI development., But AlphaGo caught Sedol off-guard. Developed by playing against itself millions of times, the software learned to be unpredictable. In the end, Sedol couldn’t determine why moves were being made., Pluribus, the Facebook and CMU collaboration, leans hard on being unpredictable.\\xa0It makes sense., Whereas checkers, chess and even Go are limited to two players, poker traditionally involves more, creating a significant challenge for an AI. Exploiting the weaknesses of a single player would not be enough. Pluribus was designed to take on five world-class opponents simultaneously., With six players, six hands of cards, the bets, and the sheer multitude of possible outcomes, the game would have overwhelmed even the most robust supercomputer. Pluribus needed a reliable edge., The edge researchers used was counterfactual regret minimization., The big idea: During training, as Pluribus played against itself, the AI noted the outcome of games given all of the variables. Then, the software systematically played game after game, altering a variable each time., Pluribus learned that some moves, even crazy ones, were winners in defined circumstances. Flummoxed players, for example, would fold. And that is the key., We humans fidget nervously; we behave predictably when we are anxious. Professional poker players can spot these tells a mile away. Pluribus does not really play to its opponents’ weaknesses. It plays to its inherent strength — it has no tell. It is completely unpredictable., The proof is in the gameplay., Researchers set Pluribus up against world-class professional poker players, including Jimmy Chou, Seth Daniels, Michael Gagliano, Sean Ruane and Jacob Toole. In 10,000 hands of Texas Hold ‘Em with five other players, Pluribus won chips consistently, along with high praise from its human competitors., Ruane even marveled at its relentless consistency., Public cloud infrastructure is democratizing computer processing and data storage.

This is ironic because the whole thing about crypto is security and the safety it brings to things, especially information., However, crypto has been beset on all sides by scammers. Whether it is disappearing exchanges, scam initial coin offerings, robbers, hackers, fake investment schemes or goings on in the dark web, crypto has a massive crime problem., Where there are resources there are predators, so this should not be a surprise., Facebook’s Libra project recently being dragged to congress for hearings to explain itself is causing a stir even while it now seems that it will be some time before it goes live. A global private sector currency with a vast captive audience has made quite a few government money folks’ eyes bug out. Libra is a monetary ‘Mars attack.’ It is also an inevitable one, bound to be followed by many large organizations in search of printing their own money., The flip side of the criminal onslaught is the huge interest that bitcoin and other cryptos garner in the general populations. You can’t be interviewed as a public figure without someone popping a bitcoin question at you. It’s as if every financial and political figure was asked about the future and stock price of Netflix, a company with a similar market cap to bitcoin. This interest is not going away and will be a driver for the whole industry in the same way that bottom up interest in being online drove the take up of the internet and WWW., So it is not surprising that this week finds the first flush of libra crypto scammers moving in to steal money from the unwary., At least one criminal outfit has advertised access to libra on Facebook this week inviting \"expressions of interest in libra.\" Anyone who registered for that would then get hit up by a boiler room., The curious user reported the following:, “Today I get a call from a boiler room saying they are Facebook in Switzerland and wanting me to set up an account so I can trade. Apparently, I don’t need to worry if I have not done it before; a broker could do it for me. They were going to give $300 to start with to trade implying this was $300 of libra.”, This is all reminiscent of the criminals who worked in \"binary bets\" a simple bilk where if the vicious gambling product didn’t get you, then the company would by simply not paying your money back, which was vastly more likely to be what you had left after losses than winnings. This was a very lucrative racket for some very shady people creating such a pestilence that the EU and many other jurisdictions shut down the basis of the swindle, the trading of binary bets. , If you see anything like this in future, simply ignore it. The Libra scams have begun and there will be a world more of them coming our way., The question I really want answered is, how on earth did this outfit get to advertise on Facebook? Having been pummeled for a $5 billion fine for not keeping its users safe, here is a blatant example of Facebook putting its users at risk, by enabling a shady, unregulated and likely criminal organization to prey on its users., It’s unlikely that this crypto ad showed up on this user’s Facebook without there being a filter for him being a trader, crypto enthusiast or investor. Even if Facebook didn’t specifically target him for this outfit, how could it even get onto the platform at all?, If Facebook is going to launch Libra, it needs to care about these things and start locking out the obvious predators from its estate.

In his letter, he asks for information in a number of areas about the groups and the internal investigation, and notes that the CBP did not honor his request for a briefing on the matter., Spokesmen for the CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment., In a statement, a Facebook spokesman said the company has \"been in regular contact with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee and will continue to work with the committee to lawfully obtain the information it is seeking.\", \"We are also continuing to cooperate with federal authorities,\" the spokesman added., ProPublica noted that the CBP posts, made in secret Facebook groups known as \"I\\'m 10-15\" and \"The Real CBP Nation\" come as \"the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces.\", Cummings has issued an expansive data request to CBP, calling for the agency to turn over every piece of content from the secret Facebook groups dating to Jan. 20, 2017, along with identifying information about the thousands of current and former CBP employees who were members of the groups., He is also seeking the name, position and employment status of every employee who is under investigation., Cummings further asks the CBP to comply with his request for a briefing on the matter by Aug. 7, 2019., Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...]', '[Flickr Creative Commons photo courtesy of www.shopcatalog.com, By the time the final numbers are tallied later this year, that number will likely be much higher., While the Pan-Mass Challenge’s eye-popping increase in Facebook revenue is an outlier, it is emblematic of Facebook’s growing impact on peer-to-peer fundraising in 2019., It’s been more than three years since Facebook began allowing individuals to raise money through the platform, but the social-media giant has only recently been stepping up its efforts to partner directly with charities and fundraising platforms., Such partnerships have exploded thus far in 2019 — and organizations across North America report that they are seeing a significant surge in new donors as a result., This isn’t just true for big-name events like the Pan-Mass Challenge., And while it’s still too early in 2019 to get a full read on how much it will impact peer-to-peer fundraising overall, some new research is shedding light on how fundraisers and their donors are using Facebook — and what it might mean for organizations that are looking to better understand how it fits in with their other fundraising channels., Here are 5 things we’ve already learned:, This early research shows that Facebook is already significantly changing the habits of individual fundraisers.

This problem of human latency is a key hurdle for tech giants like Google and Facebook that are looking for new ways to grow by shoving ever-more petabytes of data into our brains, and vice versa. , As part of their effort, Facebook has been funding a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) working to help patients with neurological damage to speak again by detecting imagined speech in real time. , \\xa0Facebook hopes the work of the UCSF team will serve as a proof of concept to inform the development of the non-invasive wearable it dreams of pairing with AR glasses., \\xa0\"If we can now measure signals in the brain via implantable devices, then we can transmit those signals outside of the brain.\", Facebook thinks that a promising way to make the leap from \"reading minds\" via wired electrodes to a wireless system is by measuring changes in oxygen levels in the brain using infrared light similar to a pulse oximeter at a doctor\\'s office. , \"This could work, though I am afraid that the rates (timing) of oxygenation processes are much lower than the actual rate at which speech is produced,\" Josep Jornet, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, told me. \"Certainly more work is needed, but this is what research is about and should be promoted.\", Todd Richmond, an IEEE member and Director of the Tech and Narrative Lab at the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica says \"having a viable capability in the lab\" to wirelessly send brain signals to a computer could be less than five years away., \\xa0\"It will likely take longer to move from the lab to commercial deployment for a variety of reasons,\" he adds., Richmond thinks the first hurdles will be solving technical problems to make the system lighter, smaller, faster and essentially, more practical.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered the opening keynote to the FB Developer conference, Set to launch this Fall, Catalina is equally unlikely to thrill consumers that are on the verge of recession but more so, who don't trust you. Facebook should be wary of spending so much time, money and effort building products that people don't want when the one you are famous for is on fire in multiple areas. What should Facebook do to build trust? Change your ways would be a smart play - even just a little. Facebook doesn't seem to want to as that may halt the money printing presses, the big blue app keeps working 24/7. , Facebook doesn't need to decide whether they want to be a force for good and have a product that they want people to use not feel they have to use.

The issue ahead of Facebook becomes less if people will ever trust Facebook again, that ship has sailed unless they find a new business model.

It also agrees to produce quarterly compliance reports and add an independent board committee to oversee its privacy practices., But that doesn\\'t go nearly far enough, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy counsel at the digital rights group Public Knowledge., \"Under this settlement, Facebook does not have to meaningfully change how it collects and uses your data. Facebook retains complete control over when to share your data outside of Facebook, as long as the company complies with the privacy policy that it gets to write,\" Slaiman said., The agreement does nothing to address the competitive advantages that Facebook enjoys by virtue of its size and reach, and could even insulate the company from further enforcement actions, she argues., \"While the settlement does require additional auditing processes and reporting requirements as well as a very large fine, the settlement is weak given the repeated violations and the severity of the harm,\" Slaiman said. \"We must pass new and more effective privacy laws, as well as broader platform regulation aimed at improving competition in the sector so that consumers can more easily switch to an alternative product if they are not happy.\", Not all of the criticisms of the settlement came from consumer advocates who wanted the company to face tougher penalties., At TechFreedom, a think tank with a libertarian bent, president Berin Szoka observed that $5 billion is no small penalty, even for Facebook, but while the company can rather easily afford it, \"who else could?\", \"Nothing could do more to discourage competition with today\\'s tech giants than the looming threat of such massive fines,\" Szoka said. \"Those cheering today\\'s settlement as a victory against Big Tech should think twice about its long-term effects on those trying to dethrone Facebook.\", Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...]', '[Getty Images, The encryption debate is typically framed around the concept of an impenetrable link connecting two services whose communications the government wishes to monitor. The reality, of course, is that the security of that encryption link is entirely separate from the security of the devices it connects. The ability of encryption to shield a user’s communications rests upon the assumption that the sender and recipient’s devices are themselves secure, with the encrypted channel the only weak point., After all, if either user’s device is compromised, unbreakable encryption is of little relevance., This is why surveillance operations typically focus on compromising end devices, bypassing the encryption debate entirely. If a user’s cleartext keystrokes and screen captures can be streamed off their device in real-time, it matters little that they are eventually encrypted for transmission elsewhere., Historically, compromising end devices was an expensive and complex process, powered by a cat-and-mouse game with hardware manufacturers and software vendors to find vulnerabilities that could be used to remotely install them and acquire the necessary device privileges., Such efforts are hard to scale and the more devices that are compromised, the more likely the vulnerability is to be discovered and patched., In Facebook’s vision, the actual end-to-end encryption client itself such as WhatsApp will include embedded content moderation and blacklist filtering algorithms. These algorithms will be continually updated from a central cloud service, but will run locally on the user’s device, scanning each cleartext message before it is sent and each encrypted message after it is decrypted., Facebook’s model entirely bypasses the encryption debate by globalizing the current practice of compromising devices by building those encryption bypasses directly into the communications clients themselves and deploying what amounts to machine-based wiretaps to billions of users at once., Asked the current status of this work and when it might be deployed in the production version of WhatsApp, a company spokesperson declined to comment., Of course, Facebook’s efforts apply only to its own encryption clients, leaving criminals and terrorists to turn to other clients like Signal or their own bespoke clients they control the source code of., The problem is that if Facebook’s model succeeds, it will only be a matter of time before device manufacturers and mobile operating system developers embed similar tools directly into devices themselves, making them impossible to escape. Embedding content scanning tools directly into phones would make it possible to scan all apps, including ones like Signal, effectively ending the era of encrypted communications., Governments would soon use lawful court orders to require companies to build in custom filters of content they are concerned about and automatically notify them of violations, including sending a copy of the offending content., Rather than grappling with how to defeat encryption, governments will simply be able to harness social media companies to perform their mass surveillance for them, sending them real-time alerts and copies of the decrypted content., While some phone manufacturers could distinguish themselves by offering bespoke phones with custom operating systems that do not include such scanning, such devices are likely to be rare, used only by those who are willing to go to great lengths to escape government scrutiny and thus automatically drawing substantial attention to themselves. Over time, it is likely that many governments will simply pass laws banning the possession and use of such devices, much as many jurisdictions ban devices that help speeders escape traffic tickets., In the end, encryption’s days are numbered and the world has Facebook to thank., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...]', '[Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images, Source: Messari.

In bi-partisan questioning throughout the two days, lawmakers raised a number of critical questions spanning everything from sanctions enforcement and privacy, to governance of the platform at scale., It is important for Congress to keep this in mind as it starts to move beyond asking questions and begins to make difficult decisions regarding the tradeoff between innovation and regulation along the same lines as many regulators in the U.S. are already doing., \\xa0, I am Chief Operating Officer at the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, a leading 501(c)(6) non-profit that guides the comprehensive adoption of blockchain technology acros...]', '[Getty Images, Silicon Valley has been a leading proponent of the idea of so-called “safe spaces” in colleges and businesses in which dedicated rooms are established where students and employees can go to get away from viewpoints, information and mentions that distress them or triggers past trauma. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, news relating to the new administration and its policies were a common refrain in the call for more safe spaces. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s social media platforms saturate those same vulnerable individuals with ceaseless political ads that are impossible to escape. Why don’t platforms like Facebook allow users to opt-out of political advertisements, creating digital safe spaces from content that triggers them?, In our ever more hyper-partisan world in which differing viewpoints and information that conflicts with one’s viewpoints and beliefs or which touches upon past traumatic experiences can lead to intense psychological trauma, so-called “safe spaces” have emerged in the academic and corporate world as a way to escape the traumas of the real world., Despite their growing popularity, these physical rooms have no counterpart in the digital world., Attempting to insulate oneself online from contrary viewpoints or information or from narratives that touch upon past traumatic experiences is next to impossible. By their very design social media platforms are constructed to flood their users with an endless stream of information that is algorithmically curated just for them, personalized to maximize their reaction. Given that outrage provokes a far more energetic (and thus monetizable) response than serenity, the more social media platforms learn about us, the more they surround us with an endless curated firehose of hate and horror that is personalized just for us., Broadcast platforms like Twitter make it difficult to escape such content, since anyone can reach anyone else, yet even closed social networks like Facebook, in which connections are reciprocal, pose a growing challenge through their advertising., On Facebook a user can carefully construct their social group to ensure it consists only of those who think and act exactly like themselves, creating a homogeneous echo chamber that entirely insulates them from the outside world., Unfortunately, this echo chamber cannot protect them from advertisements., Notably absent from this list are political advertisements. Political and issue advertisements frequently touch upon the rawest and most divisive societal fracture lines that are often what drive individuals to seek refuge within those physical safe spaces. An ad for a brand of soda or bath towels at the local supermarket are unlikely to trigger trauma in the average person. Political ads, by their very nature, are designed to prompt strong emotional responses along the fault lines that define the partisan world of politics., Getting away from these ads can be nearly impossible. Today’s ads are so hyper-targeted and run in such vast quantities that no amount of clicking “don’t show me this ad” can stop the deluge, especially around election time., A user who is triggered by any mention of a particular political candidate who is running for election in their district will find it effectively impossible to escape their barrage of campaign ads on Facebook. Every login will bring another stream of ads and the more that user attempts to avoid them, the more they are likely to see., Even using Facebook’s advertising settings to manually remove every conceivable advertising selector and request that their interests not be used to show them ads will still likely end up being saturated by campaign ads. They are simply impossible to escape in today’s digital-first campaigning., For a company like Facebook that has embraced the concept of safe spaces in the physical world, why does it not offer the digital equivalent on its platform, allowing its users to get away from political advertisements that cause them enormous emotional distress?, A company spokesperson confirmed the company’s commitment to safe spaces and noted that it offers meditation spaces and special rooms for its own employees as a form of “safe space” and that for employees that feel triggered at work, many are permitted to work from home to escape those triggers. The spokesperson also noted that the company has rolled out new policies this year governing its internal message boards and communications forums in an effort to make all employees comfortable., Yet when asked why the company does not extend the same courtesy to offer the digital equivalent of such safe spaces to its two billion users to escape from advertisements that cause them deep distress or trauma and may even trigger hospitalization, the spokesperson said the company did not have comment., Asked why the company does not at the very least allow users to request that political ads be displayed with a blurred overlay with a trigger warning that requires manually clicking to see the actual ad, the company again declined to comment., This raises the question of why the company apparently does not believe that “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings” are a useful or important tool in today’s world for its users, despite extending such protections to its own employees. After all, if Facebook believed safe spaces were so important, it would roll them out on its own site by allowing users to protect themselves from triggering advertising content. Once again, the company declined to comment., Asked whether the company believes it should be held legally, ethically or morally responsible if a user suffers emotional distress or hospitalization from encountering an advertisement that triggers them given that the company actively refuses to allow users to remove political advertisements from their Facebook experience, the company again declined to comment., Given that Facebook does actively screen advertisements to ensure that they comply with its terms of service, it is not a neutral platform. It has a set of content standards and actively enforces these through moderation. This raises the question of how it would respond to the criticism that if it is actively enforcing content standards on its platform, it has a moral responsibility to provide a safe space on its platform that protects users from allowable content that triggers them. Again, the company declined to comment., Of course, one could argue that the point of advertising is to allow users to be forcibly exposed to views and perspectives they might not otherwise consume. At the same time, there must be a balance between forcible exposure to unexpected content and forced exposure to unwanted content that causes immense distress., On possibility would be to allow users to select the specific issues, political parties and candidates they would like to hear from, isolating them from issues and candidates that trigger them. Asked whether the company would consider offering such options, the company again declined to comment., Putting this all together, despite endorsing the concept of safe spaces and providing them to its own employees, Facebook appears to have little interest in offering a digital equivalent to its two billion users that would allow them to shield themselves from the increasingly divisive political and issue ads that can cause them immense trauma and distress., The company’s refusal to comment on any of these issues reminds us that for all its public statements, it has little interest in meaningful change that would impact its bottom line., In the end, as long as political ads bring in revenue, it will be impossible to escape them., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...]', '[INDIA - 2019/07/17: In this photo illustration the most popular social networking application Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

After all, financial theory argues that all relevant information about stocks is instantly priced in. Therefore, as the late John Bogle argued so well, you\\'re better off matching the market by buying a low-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund., This comes to mind in considering the latest earnings reports from Tesla and Facebook. How so? Tesla\\'s CEO Elon Musk excites all sorts of volatile emotions among his followers — love for the company\\'s products and his heroic exploits and fear as every quarterly report induces agony about whether the company will make money or meet its production targets., By contrast, Facebook\\'s CEO Mark Zuckerberg does not produce such emotional volatility. Lacking Musk\\'s charisma, he regularly outrages people when violating norms about selling peoples\\' Facebook activity to corporate and political interests. People keep getting their dopamine hits from the endless stream of likes on their Facebook posts and despite fines and threat of government interference, the company keeps on beating expectations when it reports quarterly results., If you must buy an individual stock — buy one that passes the System 2 test rather than the one that excites your System 1. For example, buy Facebook and dump Tesla. (I have no financial interest in the securities mentioned in this post)., Meanwhile Tesla failed miserably when it comes to System 2 — losing money, burning through more cash and doing so in a way that fell short of investors\\' expectations. Tesla shares are down 15% in 2019 and have risen at a more impressive 32% average annual rate since their July 2010 IPO., Facebook proved that government fines — such as the $5 billion FTC fine it\\'s paying to settle the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal — and investigations are a minor cost of sustaining its expectations-beating, profitable growth. As it transitions from a business model based on advertising to News Feed to one based on advertising to Stories (of which it has 500 million users), Messenger and WhatsApp, it grew its top line and earnings more rapidly than expected. , But it has a long road ahead to meet its production targets for 2019. Tesla still expects to sell between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019 — mostly Model 3s — of which it delivered around 158,200 in the first half of 2019. It has to deliver \"more than 200,000 in the back half of the year to hit the low-end of its guidance,\" according to CNBC. , If you must buy individual stocks, Facebook is clearly the better bet — but if you like a good story, Musk\\'s emotional ups and downs beat Zuckerberg\\'s steady dopamine drip hands down.  , Forbes Special Report: Picking the right investment opportunities is critical.

He is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand and looking away. Gambling addiction. Sincere emotions and entertainment concept., This is a big step forward for data science. It shows where the world is headed., Collecting and understanding data is key., There have been big strides in programs mastering board games like checkers and chess. A super AI called AlphaGo, a prototype from Google Mind, even conquered Go, an extremely complex Chinese strategy game. It trounced Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world, in a widely publicized match., Many software developers assumed Go was unassailable given the state of AI development., But AlphaGo caught Sedol off-guard. Developed by playing against itself millions of times, the software learned to be unpredictable. In the end, Sedol couldn’t determine why moves were being made., Pluribus, the Facebook and CMU collaboration, leans hard on being unpredictable. It makes sense., Whereas checkers, chess and even Go are limited to two players, poker traditionally involves more, creating a significant challenge for an AI. Exploiting the weaknesses of a single player would not be enough. Pluribus was designed to take on five world-class opponents simultaneously., With six players, six hands of cards, the bets, and the sheer multitude of possible outcomes, the game would have overwhelmed even the most robust supercomputer. Pluribus needed a reliable edge., The edge researchers used was counterfactual regret minimization., The big idea: During training, as Pluribus played against itself, the AI noted the outcome of games given all of the variables. Then, the software systematically played game after game, altering a variable each time., Pluribus learned that some moves, even crazy ones, were winners in defined circumstances. Flummoxed players, for example, would fold. And that is the key., We humans fidget nervously; we behave predictably when we are anxious. Professional poker players can spot these tells a mile away. Pluribus does not really play to its opponents’ weaknesses. It plays to its inherent strength — it has no tell. It is completely unpredictable., The proof is in the gameplay., Researchers set Pluribus up against world-class professional poker players, including Jimmy Chou, Seth Daniels, Michael Gagliano, Sean Ruane and Jacob Toole. In 10,000 hands of Texas Hold ‘Em with five other players, Pluribus won chips consistently, along with high praise from its human competitors., Ruane even marveled at its relentless consistency., Public cloud infrastructure is democratizing computer processing and data storage. And Software-as-a-Service companies are building bolt-on applications to turn mountains of corporate data into actionable insights., It was a bold pitch, but Stoecker was on to something bigger — digital transformation., Sales in the first quarter, which ended March 31, were $76 million, a 51% increase year over year. Gross profits were $68 million, and cash flow was $16 million.

This is ironic because the whole thing about crypto is security and the safety it brings to things, especially information., However, crypto has been beset on all sides by scammers. Whether it is disappearing exchanges, scam initial coin offerings, robbers, hackers, fake investment schemes or goings on in the dark web, crypto has a massive crime problem., Where there are resources there are predators, so this should not be a surprise., Facebook’s Libra project recently being dragged to congress for hearings to explain itself is causing a stir even while it now seems that it will be some time before it goes live. A global private sector currency with a vast captive audience has made quite a few government money folks’ eyes bug out. Libra is a monetary ‘Mars attack.’ It is also an inevitable one, bound to be followed by many large organizations in search of printing their own money., The flip side of the criminal onslaught is the huge interest that bitcoin and other cryptos garner in the general populations. You can’t be interviewed as a public figure without someone popping a bitcoin question at you. It’s as if every financial and political figure was asked about the future and stock price of Netflix, a company with a similar market cap to bitcoin. This interest is not going away and will be a driver for the whole industry in the same way that bottom up interest in being online drove the take up of the internet and WWW., So it is not surprising that this week finds the first flush of libra crypto scammers moving in to steal money from the unwary., At least one criminal outfit has advertised access to libra on Facebook this week inviting \"expressions of interest in libra.\" Anyone who registered for that would then get hit up by a boiler room., The curious user reported the following:, “Today I get a call from a boiler room saying they are Facebook in Switzerland and wanting me to set up an account so I can trade. Apparently, I don’t need to worry if I have not done it before; a broker could do it for me. They were going to give $300 to start with to trade implying this was $300 of libra.”, This is all reminiscent of the criminals who worked in \"binary bets\" a simple bilk where if the vicious gambling product didn’t get you, then the company would by simply not paying your money back, which was vastly more likely to be what you had left after losses than winnings. This was a very lucrative racket for some very shady people creating such a pestilence that the EU and many other jurisdictions shut down the basis of the swindle, the trading of binary bets. , If you see anything like this in future, simply ignore it. The Libra scams have begun and there will be a world more of them coming our way., The question I really want answered is, how on earth did this outfit get to advertise on Facebook? Having been pummeled for a $5 billion fine for not keeping its users safe, here is a blatant example of Facebook putting its users at risk, by enabling a shady, unregulated and likely criminal organization to prey on its users., It’s unlikely that this crypto ad showed up on this user’s Facebook without there being a filter for him being a trader, crypto enthusiast or investor. Even if Facebook didn’t specifically target him for this outfit, how could it even get onto the platform at all?, If Facebook is going to launch Libra, it needs to care about these things and start locking out the obvious predators from its estate.

In his letter, he asks for information in a number of areas about the groups and the internal investigation, and notes that the CBP did not honor his request for a briefing on the matter., Spokesmen for the CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment., In a statement, a Facebook spokesman said the company has \"been in regular contact with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee and will continue to work with the committee to lawfully obtain the information it is seeking.\", \"We are also continuing to cooperate with federal authorities,\" the spokesman added., ProPublica noted that the CBP posts, made in secret Facebook groups known as \"I\\'m 10-15\" and \"The Real CBP Nation\" come as \"the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces.\", Cummings has issued an expansive data request to CBP, calling for the agency to turn over every piece of content from the secret Facebook groups dating to Jan. 20, 2017, along with identifying information about the thousands of current and former CBP employees who were members of the groups., He is also seeking the name, position and employment status of every employee who is under investigation., Cummings further asks the CBP to comply with his request for a briefing on the matter by Aug. 7, 2019., Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...', 'Flickr Creative Commons photo courtesy of www.shopcatalog.com, By the time the final numbers are tallied later this year, that number will likely be much higher., While the Pan-Mass Challenge’s eye-popping increase in Facebook revenue is an outlier, it is emblematic of Facebook’s growing impact on peer-to-peer fundraising in 2019., It’s been more than three years since Facebook began allowing individuals to raise money through the platform, but the social-media giant has only recently been stepping up its efforts to partner directly with charities and fundraising platforms., Such partnerships have exploded thus far in 2019 — and organizations across North America report that they are seeing a significant surge in new donors as a result., This isn’t just true for big-name events like the Pan-Mass Challenge., And while it’s still too early in 2019 to get a full read on how much it will impact peer-to-peer fundraising overall, some new research is shedding light on how fundraisers and their donors are using Facebook — and what it might mean for organizations that are looking to better understand how it fits in with their other fundraising channels., Here are 5 things we’ve already learned:, This early research shows that Facebook is already significantly changing the habits of individual fundraisers.

This problem of human latency is a key hurdle for tech giants like Google and Facebook that are looking for new ways to grow by shoving ever-more petabytes of data into our brains, and vice versa. , As part of their effort, Facebook has been funding a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) working to help patients with neurological damage to speak again by detecting imagined speech in real time. ,  Facebook hopes the work of the UCSF team will serve as a proof of concept to inform the development of the non-invasive wearable it dreams of pairing with AR glasses.,  \"If we can now measure signals in the brain via implantable devices, then we can transmit those signals outside of the brain.\", Facebook thinks that a promising way to make the leap from \"reading minds\" via wired electrodes to a wireless system is by measuring changes in oxygen levels in the brain using infrared light similar to a pulse oximeter at a doctor\\'s office. , \"This could work, though I am afraid that the rates (timing) of oxygenation processes are much lower than the actual rate at which speech is produced,\" Josep Jornet, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, told me. \"Certainly more work is needed, but this is what research is about and should be promoted.\", Todd Richmond, an IEEE member and Director of the Tech and Narrative Lab at the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica says \"having a viable capability in the lab\" to wirelessly send brain signals to a computer could be less than five years away.,  \"It will likely take longer to move from the lab to commercial deployment for a variety of reasons,\" he adds., Richmond thinks the first hurdles will be solving technical problems to make the system lighter, smaller, faster and essentially, more practical. Next comes the process of refining the user experience to make brain interfaces a necessity rather than a novelty. ,  \"The third set of developments will be around improving accuracy, efficacy, and safety,\" he explains. \"Like any consumer product, we’ll need to sort out what agencies are looking at what aspects of how devices impact humans, both individually and from a societal level.\", I\\'ve covered science, technology, the environment and politics for outlets including CNET, PC World, BYTE, Wired, AOL and NPR.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered the opening keynote to the FB Developer conference, Set to launch this Fall, Catalina is equally unlikely to thrill consumers that are on the verge of recession but more so, who don't trust you. Facebook should be wary of spending so much time, money and effort building products that people don't want when the one you are famous for is on fire in multiple areas. What should Facebook do to build trust? Change your ways would be a smart play - even just a little. Facebook doesn't seem to want to as that may halt the money printing presses, the big blue app keeps working 24/7. , Facebook doesn't need to decide whether they want to be a force for good and have a product that they want people to use not feel they have to use. The actions of the company have shown the side they pick time and time again. Shareholders. Doing so makes Facebook a good business but not a good company. The issue ahead of Facebook becomes less if people will ever trust Facebook again, that ship has sailed unless they find a new business model. Instead, the issue will likely surround if Facebook kills or buys everything that rises up against it. Only here will the EU and FTC be of use in helping (read: force) Facebook to change its ways., Facebook needs people to buy back into it but without changing the MO of the company this isn't going to happen and eventually the head will eat the tail. Oculus Quest, Portal and other technology that Facebook makes are good products but the flesh is weak. Fix that and you have a strong play. \", 'Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg., So now it\\'s official., Facebook and the FTC, which spent months negotiating the settlement, naturally both hailed the agreement as a significant step forward for safeguarding users\\' information and protecting consumer privacy., The reaction within the community of privacy advocates was much more subdued., \"Too little, too late,\" Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center said of the settlement., \"American consumers cannot wait another decade for the Commission to act against a company that violates their privacy rights,\" Rotenberg said, calling for Congress to pass legislation that would establish a new agency focused on data protection., \"It will mark a sharper turn toward privacy, on a different scale than anything we\\'ve done in the past,\" Stretch said., \"Going forward,\" Stretch added, \"our approach to privacy controls will parallel our approach to financial controls, with a rigorous design process and individual certifications intended to ensure that our controls are working — and that we find and fix them when they are not.\", Under the agreement, Facebook affirms that it will weigh privacy considerations with every new product that it builds. It also agrees to produce quarterly compliance reports and add an independent board committee to oversee its privacy practices., But that doesn\\'t go nearly far enough, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy counsel at the digital rights group Public Knowledge., \"Under this settlement, Facebook does not have to meaningfully change how it collects and uses your data. Facebook retains complete control over when to share your data outside of Facebook, as long as the company complies with the privacy policy that it gets to write,\" Slaiman said., The agreement does nothing to address the competitive advantages that Facebook enjoys by virtue of its size and reach, and could even insulate the company from further enforcement actions, she argues., \"While the settlement does require additional auditing processes and reporting requirements as well as a very large fine, the settlement is weak given the repeated violations and the severity of the harm,\" Slaiman said. \"We must pass new and more effective privacy laws, as well as broader platform regulation aimed at improving competition in the sector so that consumers can more easily switch to an alternative product if they are not happy.\", Not all of the criticisms of the settlement came from consumer advocates who wanted the company to face tougher penalties., At TechFreedom, a think tank with a libertarian bent, president Berin Szoka observed that $5 billion is no small penalty, even for Facebook, but while the company can rather easily afford it, \"who else could?\", \"Nothing could do more to discourage competition with today\\'s tech giants than the looming threat of such massive fines,\" Szoka said. \"Those cheering today\\'s settlement as a victory against Big Tech should think twice about its long-term effects on those trying to dethrone Facebook.\", Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...', 'Getty Images, The encryption debate is typically framed around the concept of an impenetrable link connecting two services whose communications the government wishes to monitor. The reality, of course, is that the security of that encryption link is entirely separate from the security of the devices it connects. The ability of encryption to shield a user’s communications rests upon the assumption that the sender and recipient’s devices are themselves secure, with the encrypted channel the only weak point., After all, if either user’s device is compromised, unbreakable encryption is of little relevance., This is why surveillance operations typically focus on compromising end devices, bypassing the encryption debate entirely. If a user’s cleartext keystrokes and screen captures can be streamed off their device in real-time, it matters little that they are eventually encrypted for transmission elsewhere., Historically, compromising end devices was an expensive and complex process, powered by a cat-and-mouse game with hardware manufacturers and software vendors to find vulnerabilities that could be used to remotely install them and acquire the necessary device privileges., Such efforts are hard to scale and the more devices that are compromised, the more likely the vulnerability is to be discovered and patched., In Facebook’s vision, the actual end-to-end encryption client itself such as WhatsApp will include embedded content moderation and blacklist filtering algorithms. These algorithms will be continually updated from a central cloud service, but will run locally on the user’s device, scanning each cleartext message before it is sent and each encrypted message after it is decrypted., Facebook’s model entirely bypasses the encryption debate by globalizing the current practice of compromising devices by building those encryption bypasses directly into the communications clients themselves and deploying what amounts to machine-based wiretaps to billions of users at once., Asked the current status of this work and when it might be deployed in the production version of WhatsApp, a company spokesperson declined to comment., Of course, Facebook’s efforts apply only to its own encryption clients, leaving criminals and terrorists to turn to other clients like Signal or their own bespoke clients they control the source code of., The problem is that if Facebook’s model succeeds, it will only be a matter of time before device manufacturers and mobile operating system developers embed similar tools directly into devices themselves, making them impossible to escape. Embedding content scanning tools directly into phones would make it possible to scan all apps, including ones like Signal, effectively ending the era of encrypted communications., Governments would soon use lawful court orders to require companies to build in custom filters of content they are concerned about and automatically notify them of violations, including sending a copy of the offending content., Rather than grappling with how to defeat encryption, governments will simply be able to harness social media companies to perform their mass surveillance for them, sending them real-time alerts and copies of the decrypted content., While some phone manufacturers could distinguish themselves by offering bespoke phones with custom operating systems that do not include such scanning, such devices are likely to be rare, used only by those who are willing to go to great lengths to escape government scrutiny and thus automatically drawing substantial attention to themselves. Over time, it is likely that many governments will simply pass laws banning the possession and use of such devices, much as many jurisdictions ban devices that help speeders escape traffic tickets., In the end, encryption’s days are numbered and the world has Facebook to thank., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...', 'Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images, Source: Messari.

In bi-partisan questioning throughout the two days, lawmakers raised a number of critical questions spanning everything from sanctions enforcement and privacy, to governance of the platform at scale., It is important for Congress to keep this in mind as it starts to move beyond asking questions and begins to make difficult decisions regarding the tradeoff between innovation and regulation along the same lines as many regulators in the U.S. are already doing.,  , I am Chief Operating Officer at the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, a leading 501(c)(6) non-profit that guides the comprehensive adoption of blockchain technology acros...', 'Getty Images, Silicon Valley has been a leading proponent of the idea of so-called “safe spaces” in colleges and businesses in which dedicated rooms are established where students and employees can go to get away from viewpoints, information and mentions that distress them or triggers past trauma. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, news relating to the new administration and its policies were a common refrain in the call for more safe spaces. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s social media platforms saturate those same vulnerable individuals with ceaseless political ads that are impossible to escape. Why don’t platforms like Facebook allow users to opt-out of political advertisements, creating digital safe spaces from content that triggers them?, In our ever more hyper-partisan world in which differing viewpoints and information that conflicts with one’s viewpoints and beliefs or which touches upon past traumatic experiences can lead to intense psychological trauma, so-called “safe spaces” have emerged in the academic and corporate world as a way to escape the traumas of the real world., Despite their growing popularity, these physical rooms have no counterpart in the digital world., Attempting to insulate oneself online from contrary viewpoints or information or from narratives that touch upon past traumatic experiences is next to impossible. By their very design social media platforms are constructed to flood their users with an endless stream of information that is algorithmically curated just for them, personalized to maximize their reaction. Given that outrage provokes a far more energetic (and thus monetizable) response than serenity, the more social media platforms learn about us, the more they surround us with an endless curated firehose of hate and horror that is personalized just for us., Broadcast platforms like Twitter make it difficult to escape such content, since anyone can reach anyone else, yet even closed social networks like Facebook, in which connections are reciprocal, pose a growing challenge through their advertising., On Facebook a user can carefully construct their social group to ensure it consists only of those who think and act exactly like themselves, creating a homogeneous echo chamber that entirely insulates them from the outside world., Unfortunately, this echo chamber cannot protect them from advertisements., Notably absent from this list are political advertisements. Political and issue advertisements frequently touch upon the rawest and most divisive societal fracture lines that are often what drive individuals to seek refuge within those physical safe spaces. An ad for a brand of soda or bath towels at the local supermarket are unlikely to trigger trauma in the average person. Political ads, by their very nature, are designed to prompt strong emotional responses along the fault lines that define the partisan world of politics., Getting away from these ads can be nearly impossible. Today’s ads are so hyper-targeted and run in such vast quantities that no amount of clicking “don’t show me this ad” can stop the deluge, especially around election time., A user who is triggered by any mention of a particular political candidate who is running for election in their district will find it effectively impossible to escape their barrage of campaign ads on Facebook. Every login will bring another stream of ads and the more that user attempts to avoid them, the more they are likely to see., Even using Facebook’s advertising settings to manually remove every conceivable advertising selector and request that their interests not be used to show them ads will still likely end up being saturated by campaign ads. They are simply impossible to escape in today’s digital-first campaigning., For a company like Facebook that has embraced the concept of safe spaces in the physical world, why does it not offer the digital equivalent on its platform, allowing its users to get away from political advertisements that cause them enormous emotional distress?, A company spokesperson confirmed the company’s commitment to safe spaces and noted that it offers meditation spaces and special rooms for its own employees as a form of “safe space” and that for employees that feel triggered at work, many are permitted to work from home to escape those triggers. The spokesperson also noted that the company has rolled out new policies this year governing its internal message boards and communications forums in an effort to make all employees comfortable., Yet when asked why the company does not extend the same courtesy to offer the digital equivalent of such safe spaces to its two billion users to escape from advertisements that cause them deep distress or trauma and may even trigger hospitalization, the spokesperson said the company did not have comment., Asked why the company does not at the very least allow users to request that political ads be displayed with a blurred overlay with a trigger warning that requires manually clicking to see the actual ad, the company again declined to comment., This raises the question of why the company apparently does not believe that “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings” are a useful or important tool in today’s world for its users, despite extending such protections to its own employees. After all, if Facebook believed safe spaces were so important, it would roll them out on its own site by allowing users to protect themselves from triggering advertising content. Once again, the company declined to comment., Asked whether the company believes it should be held legally, ethically or morally responsible if a user suffers emotional distress or hospitalization from encountering an advertisement that triggers them given that the company actively refuses to allow users to remove political advertisements from their Facebook experience, the company again declined to comment., Given that Facebook does actively screen advertisements to ensure that they comply with its terms of service, it is not a neutral platform. It has a set of content standards and actively enforces these through moderation. This raises the question of how it would respond to the criticism that if it is actively enforcing content standards on its platform, it has a moral responsibility to provide a safe space on its platform that protects users from allowable content that triggers them. Again, the company declined to comment., Of course, one could argue that the point of advertising is to allow users to be forcibly exposed to views and perspectives they might not otherwise consume. At the same time, there must be a balance between forcible exposure to unexpected content and forced exposure to unwanted content that causes immense distress., On possibility would be to allow users to select the specific issues, political parties and candidates they would like to hear from, isolating them from issues and candidates that trigger them. Asked whether the company would consider offering such options, the company again declined to comment., Putting this all together, despite endorsing the concept of safe spaces and providing them to its own employees, Facebook appears to have little interest in offering a digital equivalent to its two billion users that would allow them to shield themselves from the increasingly divisive political and issue ads that can cause them immense trauma and distress., The company’s refusal to comment on any of these issues reminds us that for all its public statements, it has little interest in meaningful change that would impact its bottom line., In the end, as long as political ads bring in revenue, it will be impossible to escape them., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...', 'INDIA - 2019/07/17: In this photo illustration the most popular social networking application Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

How so? Tesla\\'s CEO Elon Musk excites all sorts of volatile emotions among his followers — love for the company\\'s products and his heroic exploits and fear as every quarterly report induces agony about whether the company will make money or meet its production targets., By contrast, Facebook\\'s CEO Mark Zuckerberg does not produce such emotional volatility. Lacking Musk\\'s charisma, he regularly outrages people when violating norms about selling peoples\\' Facebook activity to corporate and political interests. People keep getting their dopamine hits from the endless stream of likes on their Facebook posts and despite fines and threat of government interference, the company keeps on beating expectations when it reports quarterly results., If you must buy an individual stock — buy one that passes the System 2 test rather than the one that excites your System 1. For example, buy Facebook and dump Tesla. (I have no financial interest in the securities mentioned in this post)., Meanwhile Tesla failed miserably when it comes to System 2 — losing money, burning through more cash and doing so in a way that fell short of investors\\' expectations. Tesla shares are down 15% in 2019 and have risen at a more impressive 32% average annual rate since their July 2010 IPO., Facebook proved that government fines — such as the $5 billion FTC fine it\\'s paying to settle the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal — and investigations are a minor cost of sustaining its expectations-beating, profitable growth. As it transitions from a business model based on advertising to News Feed to one based on advertising to Stories (of which it has 500 million users), Messenger and WhatsApp, it grew its top line and earnings more rapidly than expected. , But it has a long road ahead to meet its production targets for 2019. Tesla still expects to sell between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019 — mostly Model 3s — of which it delivered around 158,200 in the first half of 2019. It has to deliver \"more than 200,000 in the back half of the year to hit the low-end of its guidance,\" according to CNBC. , If you must buy individual stocks, Facebook is clearly the better bet — but if you like a good story, Musk\\'s emotional ups and downs beat Zuckerberg\\'s steady dopamine drip hands down.  , Forbes Special Report: Picking the right investment opportunities is critical.

The potential for Facebook to become a super monopoly could be damaging to many - global domination of many markets by a single entity. , We only have to look back at the GFC to see what happens when banks become too big to fail., Just like the game of Monopoly, are we taking a massive risk in rolling the die and going along with Libra only to play in Facebook’s favour? , Well, that all depends on the playing abilities of its competition. , Playing The Chance Card , Monopoly, The oligopoly that has governed the world’s financial systems for centuries hasn’t really faced a threat to their market share, until now. , This would make Facebook a massive centralised force, diminishing the power of nation state central banks. , There could be many upsides to this, such as empowering the unbanked, and sure, playing the Chance card can advance you in the game, but there’s always that risk of a lethal consequence. , And what if the central banks can’t rise to the challenge to keep things competitive? , Well, there’s still one more opponent that could give Facebook a run for its money. , Advance To Go , Fluidity, a financial technology company based in Brooklyn, has proposed a new model and mechanism called the Tokenized Asset Portfolio (TAP) to allow real world assets to be pledged as collateral in decentralized finance.  , This would cover much of the functionality introduced by Libra, similarly a stablecoin and platform backed by real world assets such as US treasuries and high quality currencies.  , “MakerDao is the central bank of the new economy, and by providing infrastructure for automated and tailored leverage, we expect the surrounding economies to continue to grow at increasing rates,” said Fluidity co-founder and CEO Michael Oved., “By introducing real world assets to MCD through Tokenized Asset Portfolios, we are pushing forward our mission to connect legacy financial systems to decentralized finance, with the goal of making capital markets open and accessible.” , As the TAP is implemented, it is intended that more stable assets will be used to back Dai, allowing the two to look more similar. , The TAP is a potentially revolutionary new technology that allows borrowers to use their real world assets (like real estate or securities) as collateral for various blockchain-based lending applications, potentially unlocking a lower-cost and more automated source of capital with fewer intermediaries.  , This  provides both individuals and industry participants with access to low-cost, permissionless credit from alternative blockchain funding sources. , The team is initially focusing on securities lending transactions, but soon plans to expand into other types of credit products, including commercial and residential mortgages., To test this technology, this week a real world asset, U.S. Treasury securities, was pledged to a decentralized blockchain-based lending application, through the use of a TAP. , Treasuries are one of the most liquid asset classes in the world, and now there is the ability to use them in decentralized finance, resulting in disintermediation, automation, and the potential for lower cost of capital., Rolling The Dice , MakerDao is part of the Decentralized Finance, or “DeFi” movement, which replicate conventional financial tools through sets of smart contracts — specifically on Ethereum. , Blockchain-based secondary markets, such as Kyber, Uniswap, and AirSwap, as well as lending platforms, such at MakerDao, Compound, and Nuo, have begun to form the backbone of these new capital markets. , The use of smart contracts allow transactions to be programmed, automated, and completed without middlemen.   , The ethos of DeFi is to reconstruct the world of banking in a way that’s completely different from before; open and permissionless. , But will it be a match for Facebook Libra?, We’ll just have to roll the dice and watch the game unfold., Forbes Special Offer: Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free e-letter delivered to your inbox.
