      "[<p class=\"color-body light-text\">Google CEO Sundar Pichai </p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Alphabet’s stock soared nearly 9% after-hours as the company beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line in its second-quarter earnings and announced plans for a $25 billion buyback of its Class C stock. </p>, <p>As usual, most of Alphabet’s revenue came from Google’s advertising sales (nearly 84%) though it also showed strong growth in its burgeoning cloud business. The company reported advertising revenue of $32.6 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase, while its so-called Other Revenues category, which includes cloud computing and its hardware efforts, hit $6.18 billion, or a nearly 40% increase year-over-year. </p>, <p>Meanwhile, Alphabet reported that its longer term efforts—like autonomous vehicle unit Waymo and healthcare company Verily, among others—posted revenues of $162 million (up from $145 million the previous year) on losses of $989 million (an increase from $732 million the previous year). Although those “Other Bets” have consistently lost money, investors see them as the as the key to the company’s future beyond advertising. </p>, <p>“It’s important that we stay focused on building helpful products for users,” he said. </p>, <p>I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly.

      "[<p>If the entire earnings season got stuffed into one day, we’d be just about done with breakfast.</p>, <p>It’s been a nutritious one, with 79% of reporting companies coming in above expectations so far, according to FactSet. Still, lunch and dinner have to be served, and this week features about 25% of all S&amp;P 500 companies sharing results. Things got off to a mixed start with energy firm Halliburton (HAL) reporting earnings per share that beat expectations but coming up short on revenue.</p>, <p>Earnings are roughly 15% finished, and optimism is starting to build that maybe things can turn out a little better than the goose egg many people had expected. That could help explain why stocks have a positive tone this morning. By the end of this Friday, 40% of earnings will be done, and we’ll have to wait and see what the tone is like by then.</p>, <p>Something else to consider keeping an eye on this week is the situation in Washington, D.C. The House is set to go on recess after Friday, and there’s still no budget deal. If that doesn’t get straightened out, worries could build about a possible government shutdown and the debt ceiling, which the Treasury secretary said last week needs to be raised.</p>, <p>One more thing to keep in mind as the week moves along is the European Central Bank (ECB), which has a rate decision scheduled for Thursday. An interest rate cut might be in the cards, analysts said, or at least some sort of new stimulus.</p>, <p><strong>Iran Worries Still Simmering</strong></p>, <p>Last week sputtered to a close as geopolitics sailed back into the picture. News at midday Friday that Iran seized a British tanker appeared to stir up some waves, and the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) sank back after its early gains. The tanker situation hasn't been resolved as of Monday morning, and that might be part of what’s giving crude a 2% boost. There’s growing concern about potential supply disruptions to the energy-rich Persian Gulf.</p>, <p>Going back to Friday, it looked like one of those times when the market’s been up a lot recently and people decided to take some risk off the table going into the weekend. What’s interesting is how crude only rose about $1 on the Iran news and volatility didn’t get much of a lift, at least initially. However, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)—the most closely watched “fear indicator”—did begin to climb more as Friday’s session advanced, finishing above 14. It had spent much of last week below 13.</p>, <p>The tension with Iran is a reminder that outside events continue to play a role, and that goes beyond the obvious trade battle with China. U.S. stocks are arguably priced for perfection up here near all-time highs as investors anticipate a rate cut by the end of this month. However, a shaky first week of earnings, growing Brexit concerns, and a debt limit battle shaping up in Congress all could stand in the way of continued gains. So could any bad news on the China trade front or if the tensions with Iran get worse.</p>, <p><strong>Miss on Earnings? Get Punished</strong></p>, <p>With the first full week of earnings season behind us, the prediction made before earnings started appears to hold true for reporting companies: If you beat, you may be mildly rewarded, but if you miss, you are likely to get pounded. It’s the biggest overall trend, and we saw it with Netflix (NFLX) and CSX (CSX) both taking a beating when they came up short, and Microsoft (MSFT) and some of the bank stocks only getting slight lifts when they surpassed expectations.</p>, <p>Last week's batch of corporate earnings also appeared to show that consumers are spending money, but companies have a wide range of potential problems heading into the second half of the year. Industrial companies are likely to continue dealing with the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, and the market’s collective eye could also be focused on slowing growth for some key manufacturing data all around the world. Some of this could show up in earnings.</p>, <p>This week, investors are likely to focus on projections from chipmakers and what social media company executives have to say about the impact of government inquiries into privacy issues. Some of the key companies reporting this week include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), Ford (F), AT&amp;T (T), and Twitter (TWTR).</p>, <p><strong>Silence is Golden This Week at the Fed</strong></p>, <p>Though earnings pick up later this week, Fed speakers go into a short hibernation as the silent period begins ahead of next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. There was a lot of scuttlebutt late last week after New York Fed President John Williams appeared to hint at a half-point rate cut, but that anticipation kind of dwindled Friday when the New York Fed walked back those comments, saying they were “academic” and not necessarily related to the meeting ahead.</p>, <p>The new week begins with CME Group futures showing investors firmly in the camp of expecting just a 25-basis point cut, with approximately 75% odds of that. Falling hopes for a 50-point cut might also have weighed on stocks toward the end of Friday’s session. A 75% chance doesn’t guarantee a 25-point cut, but typically a percentage this high so close to a meeting has proven correct in the past.</p>, <p>Looking at the data picture, existing and new home sales for June both come out early this week, but things get more exciting Friday when the government delivers its first estimate for U.S. Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) growth. At this point, analysts look for growth of just 1.8%, according to a consensus estimate from Briefing.com. That’s down from 3.1% in Q1, and would be the lowest quarterly GDP growth since Q1 of 2017.</p>, <p>As economic growth slows, U.S. Treasury yields just can’t get it going. The 10-year yield finished the old week under 2.06% after climbing above 2.1% a few days earlier. These geopolitical tensions wouldn’t seem likely to help yields much, as situations like this often send investors fleeing into what they see as “defensive” investments like Treasuries (yields move in the opposite direction of the underlying Treasury note).</p>, <p>However, if investors were feeling cautious Friday, they didn’t show it through their choice of sectors. The so-called “defensive” sectors like Real Estate and Utilities were some of the worst performers of the day, while Industrials and Energy were among the few to rise.</p>, <p>On the plus side, transport stocks kept gaining Friday as another solid earnings report came in, this time from KC Southern (KSU). That followed strong Union Pacific (UNP) results earlier in the week and raised hopes that trains and trucks remain full of goods, which can signal healthy economic demand. An earnings beat from American Express (AXP) late last week fell into the same category. The latest University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report out Friday for early July rose from June.</p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">STOCKS AND GOLD IN SYNC: Stocks (SPX - candlestick) and gold (/GC - purple line) spent parts of last week moving together, with both reaching significant highs recently. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, which could be favorable for gold and stock prices, which don’t always rally together. Data Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</p>, <p>NVR Inc. (NVR)—up 45% year to date and one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S.—reported quarterly results Friday that beat revenue and earnings expectations. The company’s new home orders increased 6%, but the average price of those homes declined, showing the market may be favoring less expensive homes over luxury homes lately. Next up for signs of how homebuilders are faring, consider watching for PulteGroup (PHM) earnings before the opening bell tomorrow.</p>, <p>As one analyst pointed out on CNBC, you don’t even have to go too far back to find the last time a relief rally occurred for a stock in the case of bad news people had expected. Facebook (FB) shares rose earlier this month after FB got fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its privacy practices. Does all this mean bad news is good? Not exactly, but maybe when it comes to companies facing trouble, the lesson is to hope for the best but prepare for the worst.</p>, <p><em>TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

      "[<p><span>Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), a tech giant trailing the broader market, reports quarterly earnings after the closing bell July 25. Perhaps investors may get some fresh news to give the stock more momentum after a sluggish quarter these past few months.</span></p>, <p><span>Several Wall Street analysts have cited the lack of transparency as a main concern with the company last quarter. So, maybe now executives may offer some clarity around earnings trends, whether or not there’s signs of revived growth this time around. We’ll have to see.</span></p>, <p><strong>Where Q1 Results Triggered Concerns</strong></p>, <p><span>Last quarter, GOOGL reported earnings of $11.90 per share, higher than the $10.61 the Street expected. But its revenue of $36.34 billion, which included decelerating ad revenue, fell nearly $1 billion short of expectations. </span></p>, <p><span>Alphabet revenue was up 17% year over year in Q1, which is substantial, however it’s off from the more than 20% consistent revenue growth it had been seeing, including 20% growth in the year prior. Furthermore, its ad revenue grew 15%, paling in comparison to the 24% growth the year prior.</span></p>, <p><span>It was the slowest sales growth the company has seen since 2015, but executives did not directly address the subject on its conference call. Instead, they focused on pockets of significant growth in the company such as areas of mobile search, cloud and YouTube. </span></p>, <p><span>Shares of GOOGL the past quarter have not been up to the torrid pace of the Technology sector. They’re up close to 9% as of July 24, whereas the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP) has gained 25% during that same time. Just before its Q1 report, GOOGL was up 24% year to date hitting record highs, so it’s losses since have been significant. Although keep in mind that shares have made some recovery in the last month.</span></p>, <p><strong>What to Consider Watching in the Numbers</strong></p>, <p><span>One of GOOGL’s key metrics is its paid clicks, which show whether traffic volumes are growing. A larger audience can help offset any price reduction in ads. Last quarter, paid clicks were up 39% year over year, which again sounds like a lot until you consider that they were up 66% in the prior quarter and up 62% in the quarter before that. The company’s finance chief attributed the slumping growth to changes they company made in its YouTube user experience. So, keep your eye out for whether growth in paid clicks made any recover in Q2.</span></p>, <p><span>Also, consider watching GOOGL’s traffic acquisition costs, which are mainly what it pays companies to be the default search engine or for other ways of generating traffic to its website. In recent years, the company has been able to keep this figure fairly stable, even beating analysts’ expectations last quarter when it reported $6.8 billion for the metric.</span></p>, <p><span>Margins, which were lackluster last quarter, may also be in the spotlight. Q1 profit and operating margins shrunk as it invested more in hiring and YouTube as well as data centers. We’ll see whether those costs are continuing to balloon, or whether GOOGL has scaled back there.</span></p>, <p><span>Finally, take a look outside of GOOGL’s main search engine business for how its other endeavors like its cloud computing, hardware businesses and new video streaming service Stadia are faring. Or maybe watch for what else it may have in the pipeline, say with driverless cars or other innovations that could drive growth.</span></p>, <p><span>As a side note, consider digging a bit deeper to look at how much GOOGL is spending on its cloud business as it tries to compete with Mircrosoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, which are dominating that market. If history is any indication, that cost should be a pretty good part of its overall costs, and this quarter’s figures will reveal whether those costs are increasing or not.</span></p>, <p><strong>Alphabet Options Activity</strong></p>, <p>Options activity has been light in both the Class A (GOOG) and Class C (GOOGL) shares. There has been some put activity at the GOOGL 1120 and 1125 strikes, but the highest concentration has been way to the upside, in the GOOGL 1200 calls. The implied volatility sits at the 41st percentile as of today.</p>, <p><em>Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.</em></p>, <p><span> </span></p>, <p>I am Chief Market Strategist for TD Ameritrade and began my career as a Chicago Board Options Exchange market maker, trading primarily in the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 50</p>]\n"

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">istock.com</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>, <p>This morning delivered a diversion from the steady drumbeat of earnings with an update from the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB finished its meeting today without announcing a new rate cut, but hinted strongly that one could happen in September.</p>, <p>The ECB hasn’t cut rates since 2016, and the economy there continues to sputter. Yesterday included weak manufacturing data from Germany. Low rates in Europe can pump up the dollar vs. the euro. So anything the ECB ends up doing could have an impact on the U.S. market.</p>, <p>A strong dollar is already causing some problems for big U.S. companies selling products overseas, and the situation got more serious early Thursday as the dollar index climbed toward 98. Just a month ago it was under 96. It hasn’t been over 98 since May.</p>, <p>The other impact of low rates in Europe is pressure on U.S. rates. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell early Thursday to just over 2.01%, and looks like it could threaten to fall below 2% again. One reason some analysts think the Fed is likely to cut rates next week is to put them more in line with rates overseas, though U.S. borrowing costs would still be way above those in Europe.</p>, <p>Back home, it’s been a pretty good earnings season overall, and the drumbeat continues this afternoon with two of the biggest names of all, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). So far, 75% of companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share, according to FactSet. We’re about one-third of the way through earnings season.</p>, <p>Before hearing from AMZN and GOOGL later today, the morning papers landed at the front door with good news from 3M (MMM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and American Airlines (AAL), which all beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates. Last night saw nice results from Facebook (FB), but the brakes slammed over at Tesla (TSLA), which very much under-delivered and remains a tough one to figure out.</p>, <p>Though TSLA missed analysts’ earnings per share projections, it did stick to its guidance for 2019 vehicle sales. The company has reported losses two quarters in a row after two quarters of profit last year, and the stock fell more than 11% in pre-market trading.</p>, <p>While FB stock initially climbed 3% after reporting, it quickly backtracked to slight losses despite topping third-party consensus on both top and bottom lines. That kind of tepid response might reflect what we talked about earlier this week regarding how companies under regulatory scrutiny might not see strong gains even if quarterly results impress. The stock did climb again in pre-market trading.</p>, <p>On a positive note, beer consumption is up. That’s the read from Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), which reported earnings and sales above analysts’ estimates. Beer volumes rose 2.2% in the quarter.</p>, <p>PayPal (PYPL) beat on earnings but missed on revenue. Still, the company reported 9 million active new accounts and raised guidance. A lot of analysts upgraded the stock.</p>, <p>Going back to MMM a minute, the company had really good earnings, and their CEO talked about great progress in the face of continued slow growth conditions. He didn’t emphasize sales as much as improved cash flow and managing costs. This could be seen as a cautionary note.</p>, <p>In data news, June durable goods came in better than expected. The first government estimate for Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) comes tomorrow.</p>, <p>If there’s a predictable thing about the markets, it’s that they often act unpredictably. Wednesday’s action was a good example.</p>, <p>For instance, crude prices crumbled despite a huge weekly draw out of U.S. stockpiles. The Technology sector performed pretty well even though just the day before the government announced a Department of Justice investigation that might affect some of the sector’s biggest firms.</p>, <p>At the same time, earnings continued to offer people their choice of what company’s lens they want to view things through. This is a conundrum for all market participants now. Which signal do you look at to say how the market is doing?</p>, <p>For instance, do you look at Caterpillar, whose quarter ran into a China roadblock, and say China is a big problem going forward and that’s the main story for the market?</p>, <p>Or do you see it through the lens of Texas Instruments (TXN), which had a fantastic quarter all around and helped the Semiconductor sector throw a Wall Street party Wednesday? Some analysts see the chip market as a barometer of global growth, so if chip companies do well, doesn’t that mean things are generally OK? It all depends on how you look at things.</p>, <p>Still, we aren’t completely through the chip industry reporting season, with Intel (INTC) earnings still ahead and that company often offering a different take on the sector. That’s why it’s too soon to say the chip sector has bottomed. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose more than 3% Wednesday.</p>, <p>Another lens to look through comes from Visa (V), whose earnings beat expectations for every aspect of the business. This brings us back to the consumer, who ultimately seems to be driving the current stock market rally.</p>, <p>One thing predictable thing about Wednesday was the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s ($DJI) underperformance compared with the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP). Disappointing earnings results from $DJI components Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) had a lot to do with that, but even there you had a little bit of unpredictability because most of the big financial stocks rose despite declining rates.</p>, <p>Speaking of unpredictable markets, U.S. crude stocks fell more than 10 million barrels in the most recent weekly update from the government, but crude pulled back sharply Wednesday.  It looks like analysts shook off the report by saying it reflected lower production and imports due to the hurricane a couple weeks ago. If you look at the U.S. crude chart over the last month, $55 a barrel has been a pretty clear support point, and the market bounced again late Wednesday after falling below $56.</p>, <p>One thing finding almost no support this week is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which descended down toward 12 on Wednesday and seems to be getting ready for its summer slumber. The last two summers saw VIX spend a lot of time under 12. The VIX fell under 12 intraday Wednesday for the first time since mid-April. It had climbed well over 20 back in May.</p>, <p>It’s hard to see that happening this year considering all the China trade and Brexit worries, but the agreement this week between Congress and the White House to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government opened might have helped lower the volatility volume a little for now. Also, earnings being a little stronger than many analysts had expected might be calming things down a bit.</p>, <p>The wild card for volatility, besides those geopolitical factors, might end up being the Fed. While futures prices have baked in a 25-basis point rate cut next week, there’s uncertainty about what comes next (see more below). If the Fed throws a curveball in its statement or press conference, we could see VIX roar back.</p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">FIGURE 1: VIX SUMMER SNOOZE? The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX - candlestick) fell to its lowest levels since mid-April and went below 12 at one point, down from above 20 back in May. VIX’s decline coincided with a record-high close for the S&amp;P 500 (purple line), and might also reflect declining worries about earnings and Washington politics. Data Source: Cboe Global Markets, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</p>, <p>One thing that could work its way into the Fed’s playbook is gross domestic product (GDP).</p>, <p>The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow meter predicts 1.6% growth in Q2, and many Wall Street analysts don’t see much of a comeback in Q3 and Q4. However, if GDP starts to look better than expected, that could mean the Fed starts to push back on calls for another rate cut after this month. If the Fed vocally pushes back in either its statement or at Powell’s press conference next week, that could potentially change the bullish feelings around the stock market a bit.</p>, <p>The Fed is likely to provide a look next week at its own projections for growth in the second half, and tomorrow brings the government’s first look at Q2 GDP growth. Analysts see growth of just 1.8%, according to Briefing.com, which would be the lowest since Q1 of 2017 and down from 3.1% in Q1. A Wall Street Journal analyst survey shows average GDP estimates of under 2% for the final two quarters of this year, as well.</p>, <p>New home sales for June also came in below expectations, with downward adjustments to the April and May numbers. “Overall sales activity remains tepid despite the fundamental supports of low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and a tight supply of existing homes for sale,” Briefing.com noted. Maybe investors can get a better sense of demand for new homes next week when homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) before the Tuesday’s open.</p>, <p><em>TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

      "[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, Alphabet's $720 billion market capitalization is driven by the value of its users' data.  Google's breadth and depth of customer engagement is extraordinary. I am writing this column in Google Docs using a Chromebook and will proofread it on my Android phone using Chrome and then forward it to my social networks through that browser with an additional distribution to select contacts via my Gmail influencers' mailing list.  That is five degrees of engagement for one column. It is an extraordinary level of customer contact. It also may be too much.</span></p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">New York, USA- 11 May 2019: Google office near Chelsea market. Google is one of top search engine in the world which first start its business in California.</p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Who decides how much is too much?  It would be refreshing if that answer were anything other than “government,” but, sadly, that is the reality of the situation.  It is not just one government, of course, as Google has had multiple run-ins with European regulators--including the imposition of a 1.49 billion euro fine in March--as well as its 2013 antitrust case versus the Justice Department, widely heralded as a victory for the tech company.  This ignores China, where google.com is blocked, although some have access to its search capabilities through Virtual Private Networks. The smoke signals from Mountain View are not easy to read regarding China, but one could easily paint a scenario in which Google gradually eases its way into search activities on the mainland, thereby adding another 1.3 billion users to its ecosystem.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The issue driving the decline in Alphabet shares isn’t the potential for new customers, though, it is the possibility that the U.S government could hamper the company’s ability to have such a multifaceted hold on current customers.  </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Break up Google!</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How much would that hurt Alphabet shareholders?  Well, first, let me clear up some confusion about the composition of that shareholder base.  Alphabet has three classes of stock:</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Class A (GOOGL): these shares hold one voting right.  There were 299.4 million Class A shares outstanding as of March 31st, 2019.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Class B (no public market) these shares hold ten voting rights.  Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page owned a combined 84.2% of the B shares as of December 31st, 2018, giving them 51.2% of the total votes, effectively controlling Alphabet.  There were 46.5 million B shares outstanding as of March 31st.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Class C (GOOG).  These shares hold no voting rights.  There were 340.7 million Class C shares outstanding as of March 31st. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, even though Page and Brin continue to control Alphabet, the A shares (GOOGL) do give investors a seat at the Board table, and thus could be expected to command a slight premium to the C shares.  In today’s trading that premium is about $2 per share, though, a negligible amount on the base of a $1,030 stock. </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, the choice between owning GOOG or GOOGL is really an academic one.  The choice of whether to own Alphabet or not, though, rests on exogenous factors, as seen by today’s plummet in both GOOG and GOOGL.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Obviously there is a wide range of potential outcomes from potential DOJ action against Alphabet, but the worst case scenario is that Google becomes, essentially, a regulated utility.  That would be catastrophic for shareholders, given the low valuations accorded such regulated entities. A more likely outcome from regulation would be a market revaluation of Alphabet into a slow-growth, highly-profitable company that does not pay a dividend, although certainly has the means to do so.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The description would have fit Apple five years ago, but of course the Cupertino giant has become proactive in returning money to shareholders.  In Silicon Valley, though, that can be seen as a sign that growth prospects are waning.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Apple currently receives a P/E ratio of 15.2x fiscal 2019 earnings.  Even after today’s pasting, Alphabet shares are still getting a 21.2x estimated 2019 earnings.  Another valuation method--and always the default setting for those of us who worked as sell-side analysts following industrials--is to throw up one’s hands while attempting to value a growth-challenged company and say “just give it a market multiple.”   According to FactSet, the S&amp;P 500’s current forward P/E is 15.9x 2019 EPS.</span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, based on Wall Street’s current consensus EPS estimate of $48.44 for Alphabet in 2019, an Apple multiple would imply a fair price for Alphabet of $736 per share and a market multiple would imply a fair price of $770 per share.  </span></p>, <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The numbers don’t lie.  If indeed the innocence has ended for Google, Alphabet shares have more than 25% downside from current levels.  Be careful. </span></p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I have researched stocks for 27 years, starting fresh out of college at Lehman Brothers and then moving to Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Should you buy or sell Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet.</p>, <p>Before we jump into the Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet, let’s start with the much broader technology index, the Nasdaq 100. I’m going to go so far as to say that as excited as we should be about the broader market making new highs, we need to look a bit more closely at the chain of events.</p>, <p>It was, in fact, the Nasdaq 100 that first broke through the October 2018 high on April 17th as opposed to the S&amp;P 500 that took till April 29th, almost two weeks later. It might be argued that technology was the leader, and the rest of the market, the follower.</p>, <p>That said, from my personal experience, I have noticed an interesting relationship between new highs and the strength of stocks. In addition, I am further convinced when I consider this data-driven relationship in context, in the sense that the thesis is logical. Namely, that the demonstration of eagerness amongst buyers that push up a thing so aggressively that it reaches new heights seems to reasonably suggest that there’s something special about it. Likewise, if buyers push up one group of stocks before another group, it seems logically consistent with the crowd preferring the first group! The reasonability is compelling.</p>, <p>And Alphabet is the most interesting one, having surpassed its Oct 2018 level as early as March 20th (a sign of strength as the first one to break through that particular gate), and then making a new all-time high on the very same day as the S&amp;P 500. But then it gave back significantly with a disappointing earnings reports, dropping about 7% on April 30th to land up back below its October 2018 levels.</p>, <p>These are all interesting data points, but let’s not get into the nitty-gritty. Instead, let’s just step back and recognize the big picture, that none of these are keeping up with either the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. Outside of their independent nuances, this is the troubling fact, the perceived leaders are acting like laggards. Clearly, they are not the ones that the crowd is heaving themselves at.</p>, <p>Once establishing “person of interest” status, the next thing to do is to start looking deeper, with a slight tilt toward skepticism given the existing status. After establishing person of interest status, the detective's job is to assess more clues that align with the working theory, and where possible, more conclusive evidence. We need to do the same.</p>, <p>For example, Apple was sharp, from October to the December low it is straight down, and from that bottom, straight up; like a perfect “V” (although the right side not having reached the top of the left side). This, to me, demonstrates panic; panic to get out, and then once at a low enough level, a panic to get in. Apple has been the darling, so both buyers and sellers panic. And while the seller side is not so great, the buyer panic (of missing out) is definitely a good sign. But, then again, with all that panic to get into Apple from the bottom, it couldn’t even make it to its old high. Hhmmm.</p>, <p>In contrast, from its December 2018 low, Amazon just moved sideways for a while. From January 1 to mid-March, it went nowhere, just stuck range bound while it was making a decision. After it broke out on the upside in mid-March and continued with a healthy uptrend ever since we came to know that those prior months were consolidation; wherein market participants were patiently and thoughtfully consolidating their position, and their thoughts. This is methodical and I like it.</p>, <p>Lastly, Alphabet moved with similar intensity and sharpness to Apple, albeit not quite as rigorously. The difference is that Apple sold off 35%, so had further to recover, whereas Alphabet lost only 25% during the Q4 2018 correction, so had less to recover in 2019. More so, the 2019 uptrend included both some pullbacks and some consolidation, making its way up in a step-like fashion; aggressive but methodical. And then, unlike the others, achieved new highs.</p>, <p>With all these ideas in mind, if I had to choose, I would buy Alphabet. I look at the gap down a few days ago as a buying opportunity.</p>, <p>And as for the other two, because they are so close, I’d wait to see if they get through their all-time highs. These levels may show resistance, but whether they do or don’t, there’s no reason not to wait and see whether this unknown transforms into a known. If they make it through, I would continue buying them on pullbacks. And if not, all bets are off until they get cheaper.</p>, <p>If your investment objective is to minimize taxes, the argument against selling can be compelling. However, if your objective is to become wealthy, then holding onto a stock that has already seen its best days is a mistake.</p>, <p>In sports, this is like betting on the San Francisco 49ers because Joe Montana led them to win four Super Bowl in the 80s. Today's 49ers are an entirely different team so the fact that they did so well in the 80s does not tell you anything about their prospects for winning the next Super Bowl.</p>, <p>Similarly, prospects for Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet are not the same as they were 10 years ago. How you assess their current prospects should have nothing to do with how much you've made on these stocks.</p>, <p>If these three stocks are less than 30% of your portfolio, then I'd follow Wayne's recommendation. However, if they are already more than 30% of your portfolio, I'd want to trim them back by selling into strength.</p>, <p>I am the CEO and founder of Marketocracy, Inc.,and portfolio manager at Marketocracy Capital Management, LLC.

Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had the bright idea they could design algorithms to manage the world’s public information more effectively.</p>, <p>As a way to navigate the web, Google came out of nowhere. Unlike Yahoo!, Lycos and Alta Vista, the popular search engines at the time, it used math that prioritized how often internet pages were linked.</p>, <p>PageRank was never intended to be the basis for the biggest advertising platform the world has ever known. Hawking ads paid the bills. Google began as a math problem for curious grad students. It was refined with algorithms, massive amounts of data and computer power.</p>, <p>Teaching computers to learn and provide insights using data is what Google does.</p>, <p>Then, in 2014, the company acquired DeepMind Technologies, a British AI startup that was making progress teaching computers the quirks of human short-term memory.</p>, <p>A few years later, its custom AlphaGo code was so advanced that it became the first computer program to defeat a human in a match of Go, the ancient Chinese strategy game.</p>, <p>Go is renowned among computer scientists because it stretches the limits of human general intelligence. AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, the 18-time Go world champion, 4-1.</p>, <p>Now Alphabet is making a pitch to enterprises. Managers at Google Cloud want to use the corporate pedigree, and undisputed AI leadership, to help companies build new business models using data analytics and AI. You can see how that might appeal to large enterprises struggling to stay one step ahead of the next Amazon.com.</p>, <p>Google Cloud replaced Diane Greene with Amit Zavery as chief executive officer in November 2018. Zavery, a top ex-Oracle product manager, is a nuts-and-bolts sales guy. He has been aggressively building out a sales operation to court enterprise CIOs.</p>, <p>It all fits with Polit’s view from inside P&amp;G. The company signed its first deal with Google Cloud in early April. However, Polit says P&amp;G’s cloud spend could shift more toward Google over the next 18-24 months as data mining begins to play a bigger role in the future of the business.</p>, <p>At this stage, Google Cloud is not a material part of Alphabet’s business. Its specific numbers are mixed with “other” sales in the company regulatory filings.</p>, <p>However, the future is bright. After two decades, Alphabet finally has another use case for its core skillset in machine learning and AI.</p>, <p>Alphabet shares got smashed Tuesday, losing 7.5% on the revenue shortfall.

      "[<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">There is a theory that the Greeks developed their alphabet around the same time they wrote down Homer. They saw the need to preserve the Iliad and the Odyssey and to spread these epic poems as widely as possible. Up till then, poetry had been an oral tradition, a performance, and writing made it possible to transmit Homer to faraway places and to the future as well, which is far away in time. The forms of the letters go all the way back to the Phoenicians, and the first two letters, alpha beta, which came into English from Greek through Latin, have not changed in all that time. That the alphabet has survived, in one form or another, for so long is a testament to its usefulness and durability—to the genius of it.</p>, <p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">The Phoenician alphabet was all consonants. The innovation of the Greeks was that they used some of the symbols for vowels. This made the written language more expressive—it put the human soul into it. In order to speak, we need to breathe out, exhale, and make sounds using our throats and the resonant chambers in our heads as well as our lips and teeth and tongue. The vowels are the breath of the alphabet—they could be said to carry the human voice. They sing. In our time, email was an innovation, and before that the fax machine, and before that the telegraph (the Twitter of its time). The evolution of the alphabet as a way to record human speech was the beginning of civilization, in a way. This supple group of 24 symbols (in the Greek alphabet; the Roman alphabet has 26) made it possible for humankind to address the future and look back at the past. The other thing I think is amazing about the invention of writing is that it was originally done on clay, so it is as if we inscribed poetry into the earth itself.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Quora: The best answer to any question.\">Quora: The best answer to any question.</p>]\n"

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">istock.com</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">After two sessions of records, it remains to be seen whether the momentum will continue amid mixed earnings and data showing slowing Chinese factory growth.</p>, <p>On the earnings front, shares of Google’s parent Alphabet were down more than 7% in pre-market trading after the internet search giant reported revenue that missed expectations.</p>, <p>The company has been facing pressure from increased competition in online advertising, and this most recent quarter saw Google’s year-on-year advertising revenue growth slow to around 15% compared to roughly 24% in Q1 2018.</p>, <p>In events since its last quarterly report, the company was hit with a roughly $1.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission over what the commission said was abuse of its dominant position in the market. That’s the third massive fine for the company from the European Union in about three years, totaling about $9.4 billion.</p>, <p>But not all was doom-and-gloom in earnings news. General Electric, McDonald’s, Merck, and Pfizer all surpassed Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue.</p>, <p>They form the latest round of companies to best forecasts during this earnings season, which has been marked by low expectations. The fact that many companies that have reported so far have beaten expectations is one reason the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have posted record closes for two sessions in a row.</p>, <p>Another leg of support this year has come from a dovish Fed. The central bank starts its two-day policy setting meeting today. While policy makers are widely expected to leave the central bank’s key short-term interest rate unchanged, market participants are likely to try to glean insights into the Fed’s thinking on the economy and interest rate trajectory from comments accompanying the decision.</p>, <p>One headwind for the market this morning is economic data out of China. The nation’s official April purchasing managers index surprisingly dipped. Meanwhile a private business survey also disappointed.</p>, <p>The data underscore fears of slowing economic growth in the world’s second-largest economy even as optimism about a potential trade deal between the Asian nation and the United States has been another leg of support for the market, as has recent robust U.S. economic data.</p>, <p>In a performance akin to Friday’s, the market rose to new records Monday after strong economic data.</p>, <p>Figures from the Commerce Department showed U.S. personal spending jumped 0.9% in March, ahead of a rise of 0.8% that had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus. But during the same period, core personal consumption expenditures, which are the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in below a Briefing.com consensus expectation for a 0.1% rise. (See more below.)</p>, <p>The strong reading on consumer spending amid low inflation appeared to encourage investors about the state of the U.S. economy, especially after a surprisingly strong gross domestic product (GDP) figure last week.</p>, <p>That sentiment appeared to cause some investors and traders to move out of the relative safety of U.S. government debt. Amid the selling, the yields, which move inversely to prices, on the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year Treasury bond rose.</p>, <p>The rising yields helped the Financials sector rise more than 0.9%, making it the day’s biggest gainer. Banks tend to do better when longer-term yields are greater than shorter-term ones. That way they can earn more money on the interest they charge on loans than they have to pay out on deposits.</p>, <p>On the flip side of the coin, the rising yields helped pressure Real Estate and Utilities. These two sectors are often considered bond proxies because of their history of stable payouts.</p>, <p>When government bonds, which are considered safer than stocks, rise, that means more competition for these bond proxies, and investors can switch out of them and move into bonds. Also, for Real Estate, higher interest rates can crimp demand by making mortgages more expensive and properties less affordable.</p>, <p>Monday offered a pretty classic Investment 101 scenario of investors and traders moving into stocks and out of bonds as they appeared to feel more bullish and perhaps wanted to not get left behind if momentum buying really stepped up.</p>, <p>This FOMO (fear of missing out) trade helped send the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to record intraday and closing highs, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed higher.</p>, <p>But the day’s gains weren’t all that impressive in percentage terms, ranging from a gain of 0.04% for the Dow to 0.19% for the Nasdaq. It seems that the buying momentum was kept in check by uncertainty surrounding a busy week ahead.</p>, <p>In addition to continued earnings reports and the Fed meeting, U.S.-China trade negotiations that may be nearing a conclusion are continuing, and a widely-anticipated jobs report is scheduled for Friday morning.</p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 1: Lackluster: Gold futures dropped Monday.

      "[<p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) have been corporate fixtures for more than a decade, but there is still a bit of opacity about what ingredients CISOs add to the alphabet soup of C-level jobs.</p>, <p class=\"color-body light-text\">Generally, CISOs have a standard set of functions, ranging from creating security policies to managing their company’s security operations.</p>, <p>Prior to 1994, the role didn’t even exist. Twenty-five years later, the position has gone from a good idea to a near necessity for enterprises with complex infrastructures and compliance standards. </p>, <p>Whenever I talk about my job, whether it’s at a speaking engagement or in a one-on-one conversation, eventually someone asks me what it’s like being a CISO for a cyber security company. The short answer is that it’s always interesting. The longer, more accurate response is that it requires the ability to see things from different perspectives. </p>, <p>Generally, CISOs have a standard set of functions, ranging from creating security policies to managing their company’s security operations. I also build and lead the execution of our compliance strategy as well as writing policy and working with IT and engineering teams. However, those are internal tasks. When your company is in the business of selling security products to other businesses, your job expands to include external responsibilities. </p>, <p>On a typical day (not that you have many of those), you may spend your morning working internal compliance strategies for your new products. As part of that process, you’re likely interacting with your sales team as if you’re a prospect or a customer. CISOs frequently get pitched by outside vendors, but hearing how your company’s team pitches your own products offers an interesting peek behind the curtain.  </p>, <p>After you’re done meeting with the sales team, you could be asked to provide a customer or prospect with proof that they can add your product to their digital environment without disrupting security or business. It’s interesting to hear how our large customers are applying new policy to their own network. I often take those ideas and build them into our internal policies and push them down to our vendors.</p>, <p><strong>Developing Mitigation Strategies</strong></p>, <p>You could also get called on to find specific use cases to support sales. Advocating for your own product rather than reviewing an outside product is one pretty major difference between being a CISO at a security company and holding the same job somewhere else.</p>, <p>The size of your organization also matters when it comes to day-to-day job responsibilities.  CISOs for larger security vendors may have a compliance staff who would handle that side of things. If that’s the case, you should get to know that group as well, because they will bring a different angle of understanding to the various things you’re meant to be protecting.  </p>, <p>CISOs at smaller companies or startups probably need to take a more hands-on approach. In my case, that includes leading a research team dedicated to understanding network threats and creating detection and mitigation strategies to help our customers. </p>, <p><strong>Building a Security-Forward Culture</strong></p>, <p>Being a CISO is both challenging and rewarding, no matter where you work. You will get to team up with incredibly talented and creative people. You can help create a culture in which people realize security is everyone’s responsibility. </p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Jeff Costlow is the CISO at ExtraHop.

(GOOGL) shares have been on a rip this year, up about 21.5% year to date as of April 24, versus a 17% rise in the S&amp;P 500 (SPX). The search engine giant is scheduled to release Q1 results after the closing bell April 29.</p>, <p>As one of the FAANGs, which include Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), Google is a kind of bellwether for big players in the technology sector. For much of 2018, FAANGs’ momentum helped drive a solid rally for much of the year, and then played a large role in Q4’s steep losses. So far this year, FAANGs have had a lesser role in the more-broad-based rally, but their positive drive has certainly also contributed.</p>, <p>GOOGL itself doesn’t provide quarterly guidance, but the Street expects it to report Q1 adjusted EPS of $10.56, down from $13.33 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $37.33 billion, up 19.9% from a year ago.</p>, <p><strong>Digital Advertising Revenue Hit Plateau in Q4</strong></p>, <p>In Q4, GOOGL shares slid about 3% after it reported rising costs and a decline in advertising prices, where it gleans a good deal of revenue. Its core advertising revenue grew 20% to $32.6 billion, which was about the same rate of growth it saw in Q3, meaning that line of business had hit a bit of a plateau. Meanwhile, the costs for traffic acquisition, for example what it pays to other companies to be a default search engine, climbed 15% year over year to $7.44 billion.</p>, <p>Still, GOOGL showed it continued to expand its hardware sales and cloud business, and earnings and revenue topped Street estimates. Q4 revenue was $39.3 billion, up 22% from the year prior, and earnings were $12.77 per share, up 12% year over year.</p>, <p>Its “other revenue,” which includes Google Play, hardware and cloud computing, increased 31% year over year to $6.49 billion, although the company did not break down that number to show exactly where the growth came from. CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call that Google Cloud was one of the company’s “fastest-growing business segments.” He also said the company “more than doubled” the number of Cloud Platform deals over $1 million and the number of multi-year contracts, although he didn’t provide specifics.</p>, <p>“Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge and one that is constantly getting harder,” Pichai said.</p>, <p>In events since its last quarterly report, GOOGL was hit with a roughly $1.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission over what the commission said was abuse of its dominant position in the market. GOOGL is accounting for the entire fine in the first quarter, so that will reduce its earnings and operating income, as well as its net income. That’s the third massive fine for GOOGL from the EU in about three years, totaling about $9.4 billion, so investors are likely hoping its regulatory headaches are over soon.</p>, <p><strong>GOOGL Options Activity</strong></p>, <p>The options market has priced in about a 3.6% stock move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release</p>, <p>For the May 3 options expiration, volume has been light overall. Put options have been most active at the 1230 strike. On the call side, the 1300 strike has been the most active, followed by the 1310 strike.

Although Sidewalk Labs announced its ambitions to bid for Toronto's redevelopment in 2017, this is the first document that fully lays out its ultimate vision, which includes proposals for two neighborhoods—Quayside and Villiers West—as well as a larger Innovative Development and Economic Acceleration (IDEA) district.</p>, <p>Dan Doctoroff, the CEO of the Alphabet subsidiary and a former deputy mayor of New York City, touted the plan as a “groundbreaking blueprint for the neighborhood of the future” that is environmentally friendly and built for people of all income levels. Residential units make up 67% of the planned development in the main Quayside district, for example, with 40% at below-market prices, and Sidewalk promises 1,700 affordable housing units in all. </p>, <p>“We think it’s the first true articulation of what’s really possible when you combine cutting-edge innovation and forward-looking urban design to produce an inclusive community,” Doctoroff said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. </p>, <p>Sidewalk has stipulated the creation of an independent Civic Data Trust to handle digital governance issues and has also committed not to sell personal information, not to use personal information for advertising and not to disclose information to third parties without explicit consent.</p>, <p>Waterfront Toronto said in a statement that based on a read-through of the plans, it will require additional information to establish whether the initial proposals are in compliance with applicable laws and its own data principles. </p>, <p>Doctoroff said that Sidewalk would continue to work closely with the government and community groups to move its plan forward and described the process as “like a 50-sided Rubik's cube.” </p>, <p>The master plan outlines a capital-intensive investment for Sidewalk, though also one that could potentially be incredibly lucrative. At this point, Alphabet’s subsidiary companies like Sidewalk, called its “Other Bets,” have generated very little revenue. In the company’s most recent quarterly earnings, the “Other Bets” reported losses of $868 million and $170 million in revenue. </p>, <p>For much more detail, check out the planning documents below: </p>, <p>I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly.

A California arbitration panel reviewing Waymo’s claim against Anthony Levandowski, the former Google and Uber engineer who sparked their high-profile 2017 fight over trade secrets, determined on March 26 that he is on the hook for a $127 million award to Waymo. Uber, which acquired Levandowski’s company and brought him in to oversee its self-driving car project, said it’s contesting whether it’s obligated to pay some or all of that potential settlement, which may also include court and legal fees. </p>, <p>Additionally, an independent software investigator brought in to assess whether Uber’s driverless car system used any technology originating from Waymo found “certain functions in our autonomous vehicle software that are problematic and other functions that are not,” Uber said. </p>, <p>“If these interim findings become final, they could result in a license fee or in design changes that could require substantial time and resources to implement, and could limit or delay our production of autonomous vehicle technologies,” Uber said in the filing. </p>, <p>The review continues, and Waymo said in an emailed statement that it “will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our confidential information is not being used by Uber.”</p>, <p>Alphabet shows up a handful of times in the risks section of Uber’s filing. In addition to the mapping example, Uber also cites its reliance on Google’s app store, Play, and Apple’s App Store, as a risk, writing that it can’t guarantee that the two companies won’t start charging fees to download its app. Waymo is name-dropped as a competitor, too, along with a host of other companies working on self-driving capabilities. </p>, <p>I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly.

Like Jack Welch did with GE a generation ago, Alphabet CEO Larry Page is building an empire of companies that compete across a variety of industries.

Most of us continue to click “OK” when it comes to sharing cookies on news and media websites today simply because we want access to the data they are providing. We don’t even ask how these companies will be using the data they gather from us. We’re so hungry for the tech and information they’re offering that we forgo our right to transparency and privacy rather blindly. That’s one potential issue with Alphabet’s smart city project., Theres is a tremendous amount of potential in programs like these. However, those of us following the Alphabet smart city project need to have very open eyes about the fact that Alphabet is in fact a for-profit company, and parent company to one of the largest data machines on the planet: Google. We need to understand that every time we give “permission” to access a public service like free internet, our information will be gathered and used in ways we most likely do not even understand.

The company reported advertising revenue of $32.6 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase, while its so-called Other Revenues category, which includes cloud computing and its hardware efforts, hit $6.18 billion, or a nearly 40% increase year-over-year. , Meanwhile, Alphabet reported that its longer term efforts—like autonomous vehicle unit Waymo and healthcare company Verily, among others—posted revenues of $162 million (up from $145 million the previous year) on losses of $989 million (an increase from $732 million the previous year).

Previously]', \"[If the entire earnings season got stuffed into one day, we’d be just about done with breakfast., It’s been a nutritious one, with 79% of reporting companies coming in above expectations so far, according to FactSet. Still, lunch and dinner have to be served, and this week features about 25% of all S&amp;P 500 companies sharing results. Things got off to a mixed start with energy firm Halliburton (HAL) reporting earnings per share that beat expectations but coming up short on revenue., Earnings are roughly 15% finished, and optimism is starting to build that maybe things can turn out a little better than the goose egg many people had expected. That could help explain why stocks have a positive tone this morning. By the end of this Friday, 40% of earnings will be done, and we’ll have to wait and see what the tone is like by then., Something else to consider keeping an eye on this week is the situation in Washington, D.C. The House is set to go on recess after Friday, and there’s still no budget deal. If that doesn’t get straightened out, worries could build about a possible government shutdown and the debt ceiling, which the Treasury secretary said last week needs to be raised., One more thing to keep in mind as the week moves along is the European Central Bank (ECB), which has a rate decision scheduled for Thursday. An interest rate cut might be in the cards, analysts said, or at least some sort of new stimulus., Iran Worries Still Simmering, Last week sputtered to a close as geopolitics sailed back into the picture. News at midday Friday that Iran seized a British tanker appeared to stir up some waves, and the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) sank back after its early gains. The tanker situation hasn't been resolved as of Monday morning, and that might be part of what’s giving crude a 2% boost. There’s growing concern about potential supply disruptions to the energy-rich Persian Gulf., Going back to Friday, it looked like one of those times when the market’s been up a lot recently and people decided to take some risk off the table going into the weekend. What’s interesting is how crude only rose about $1 on the Iran news and volatility didn’t get much of a lift, at least initially. However, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)—the most closely watched “fear indicator”—did begin to climb more as Friday’s session advanced, finishing above 14. It had spent much of last week below 13., The tension with Iran is a reminder that outside events continue to play a role, and that goes beyond the obvious trade battle with China. U.S. stocks are arguably priced for perfection up here near all-time highs as investors anticipate a rate cut by the end of this month. However, a shaky first week of earnings, growing Brexit concerns, and a debt limit battle shaping up in Congress all could stand in the way of continued gains. So could any bad news on the China trade front or if the tensions with Iran get worse., Miss on Earnings? Get Punished, With the first full week of earnings season behind us, the prediction made before earnings started appears to hold true for reporting companies: If you beat, you may be mildly rewarded, but if you miss, you are likely to get pounded. It’s the biggest overall trend, and we saw it with Netflix (NFLX) and CSX (CSX) both taking a beating when they came up short, and Microsoft (MSFT) and some of the bank stocks only getting slight lifts when they surpassed expectations., Last week's batch of corporate earnings also appeared to show that consumers are spending money, but companies have a wide range of potential problems heading into the second half of the year. Industrial companies are likely to continue dealing with the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, and the market’s collective eye could also be focused on slowing growth for some key manufacturing data all around the world. Some of this could show up in earnings., This week, investors are likely to focus on projections from chipmakers and what social media company executives have to say about the impact of government inquiries into privacy issues. Some of the key companies reporting this week include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), Ford (F), AT&amp;T (T), and Twitter (TWTR)., Silence is Golden This Week at the Fed, Though earnings pick up later this week, Fed speakers go into a short hibernation as the silent period begins ahead of next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. There was a lot of scuttlebutt late last week after New York Fed President John Williams appeared to hint at a half-point rate cut, but that anticipation kind of dwindled Friday when the New York Fed walked back those comments, saying they were “academic” and not necessarily related to the meeting ahead., The new week begins with CME Group futures showing investors firmly in the camp of expecting just a 25-basis point cut, with approximately 75% odds of that. Falling hopes for a 50-point cut might also have weighed on stocks toward the end of Friday’s session. A 75% chance doesn’t guarantee a 25-point cut, but typically a percentage this high so close to a meeting has proven correct in the past., Looking at the data picture, existing and new home sales for June both come out early this week, but things get more exciting Friday when the government delivers its first estimate for U.S. Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) growth. At this point, analysts look for growth of just 1.8%, according to a consensus estimate from Briefing.com. That’s down from 3.1% in Q1, and would be the lowest quarterly GDP growth since Q1 of 2017., As economic growth slows, U.S. Treasury yields just can’t get it going. The 10-year yield finished the old week under 2.06% after climbing above 2.1% a few days earlier. These geopolitical tensions wouldn’t seem likely to help yields much, as situations like this often send investors fleeing into what they see as “defensive” investments like Treasuries (yields move in the opposite direction of the underlying Treasury note)., However, if investors were feeling cautious Friday, they didn’t show it through their choice of sectors. The so-called “defensive” sectors like Real Estate and Utilities were some of the worst performers of the day, while Industrials and Energy were among the few to rise., On the plus side, transport stocks kept gaining Friday as another solid earnings report came in, this time from KC Southern (KSU). That followed strong Union Pacific (UNP) results earlier in the week and raised hopes that trains and trucks remain full of goods, which can signal healthy economic demand. An earnings beat from American Express (AXP) late last week fell into the same category. The latest University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report out Friday for early July rose from June., STOCKS AND GOLD IN SYNC: Stocks (SPX - candlestick) and gold (/GC - purple line) spent parts of last week moving together, with both reaching significant highs recently. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, which could be favorable for gold and stock prices, which don’t always rally together. Data Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, CME Group.

(NVR)—up 45% year to date and one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S.—reported quarterly results Friday that beat revenue and earnings expectations. The company’s new home orders increased 6%, but the average price of those homes declined, showing the market may be favoring less expensive homes over luxury homes lately. Next up for signs of how homebuilders are faring, consider watching for PulteGroup (PHM) earnings before the opening bell tomorrow., As one analyst pointed out on CNBC, you don’t even have to go too far back to find the last time a relief rally occurred for a stock in the case of bad news people had expected. Facebook (FB) shares rose earlier this month after FB got fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its privacy practices. Does all this mean bad news is good? Not exactly, but maybe when it comes to companies facing trouble, the lesson is to hope for the best but prepare for the worst., TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

And it was not surprising to see the stock dip as a result., Mountain View, California, USA - March 28, 2018: Google sign at Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley. Google is an American technology company., But what sellers are missing is that this business is onto something really big …, Using data, machine learning and AI, Alphabet managers are incubating vibrant new businesses with innovative business models. One or more of these will become exciting standalone businesses., Already, some smart analysts are doing sum-of-the-parts analysis, and they like what they see., Together, these parts are probably worth well over $1 trillion., It’s an important innovation hiding inside the search giant., And it couldn’t come at a better time., This subsidiary has its roots in DeepMind Technologies, a British AI startup that was making progress teaching computers the quirks of human short-term memory. In 2014, Alphabet acquired the business., Two years later, its custom AlphaGo code was so advanced that it became the first computer program to defeat a human in a match of Go, the ancient Chinese strategy game. That human happened to be 18-time world champion Lee Sedol., At the December 2018 CASP13 meeting in Mexico, DeepMind was at it again. This time, its human challengers were the brightest minds in biology., The task: predicting the shapes of proteins., The math has vexed computational biologists for the past 25 years. They have been trying to build more predictive software models for protein-folding, the process that leads to proteins taking three-dimensional shapes., For perspective, the second-place team accurately predicted only three of the 43 proteins., This does not mean Alphabet has an inside track to the next big drug discovery.\\xa0It doesn’t work that way. Developing new drugs is both expensive and fraught with regulatory hurdles, patient trials and marketing expenses., But,\\xa0this business opportunity is increasing those odds., Computational biologists in hoodies and jeans will build personalized drug treatments based on what they know about the patient’s individual genomic makeup. Behind the scenes, data scientists using AlphaFold-like AI\\xa0will comb through algorithmic models, looking for previously unseen biomarkers., DeepMind has come out of nowhere to be a major player in that ecosystem.\\xa0And it is hiding inside Alphabet shares, practically for free., The parent company stock trades at 21x forward earnings and 5.6x sales. These metrics reflect the consensus view that Alphabet is an advertising business, subject to regulatory attacks., For the record, its\\xa0advertising business is terrific. The company had almost $39 billion in sales during the second quarter., And regulation is coming. It's true. However, the story of the stock is its valuable pieces. Investors are fretting a potential breakup of Alphabet. They should be embracing that possibility. It will lead to much higher stock prices as the value of its businesses come to light., I am an  investment adviser, trader, columnist and author based in Seattle. I publish or edit four daily publications: Strategic Advantage, on long-term investing;  Tra]\", '[Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), a tech giant trailing the broader market, reports quarterly earnings after the closing bell July 25. Perhaps investors may get some fresh news to give the stock more momentum after a sluggish quarter these past few months., Several Wall Street analysts have cited the lack of transparency as a main concern with the company last quarter. So, maybe now executives may offer some clarity around earnings trends, whether or not there’s signs of revived growth this time around. We’ll have to see., Where Q1 Results Triggered Concerns, Last quarter, GOOGL reported earnings of $11.90 per share, higher than the $10.61 the Street expected. But its revenue of $36.34 billion, which included decelerating ad revenue, fell nearly $1 billion short of expectations. , Alphabet revenue was up 17% year over year in Q1, which is substantial, however it’s off from the more than 20% consistent revenue growth it had been seeing, including 20% growth in the year prior. Furthermore, its ad revenue grew 15%, paling in comparison to the 24% growth the year prior., It was the slowest sales growth the company has seen since 2015, but executives did not directly address the subject on its conference call. Instead, they focused on pockets of significant growth in the company such as areas of mobile search, cloud and YouTube. , Shares of GOOGL the past quarter have not been up to the torrid pace of the Technology sector. They’re up close to 9% as of July 24, whereas the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP) has gained 25% during that same time. Just before its Q1 report, GOOGL was up 24% year to date hitting record highs, so it’s losses since have been significant. Although keep in mind that shares have made some recovery in the last month., What to Consider Watching in the Numbers, One of GOOGL’s key metrics is its paid clicks, which show whether traffic volumes are growing. A larger audience can help offset any price reduction in ads. Last quarter, paid clicks were up 39% year over year, which again sounds like a lot until you consider that they were up 66% in the prior quarter and up 62% in the quarter before that. The company’s finance chief attributed the slumping growth to changes they company made in its YouTube user experience. So, keep your eye out for whether growth in paid clicks made any recover in Q2., Also, consider watching GOOGL’s traffic acquisition costs, which are mainly what it pays companies to be the default search engine or for other ways of generating traffic to its website. In recent years, the company has been able to keep this figure fairly stable, even beating analysts’ expectations last quarter when it reported $6.8 billion for the metric., Margins, which were lackluster last quarter, may also be in the spotlight. Q1 profit and operating margins shrunk as it invested more in hiring and YouTube as well as data centers. We’ll see whether those costs are continuing to balloon, or whether GOOGL has scaled back there., Finally, take a look outside of GOOGL’s main search engine business for how its other endeavors like its cloud computing, hardware businesses and new video streaming service Stadia are faring. Or maybe watch for what else it may have in the pipeline, say with driverless cars or other innovations that could drive growth., As a side note, consider digging a bit deeper to look at how much GOOGL is spending on its cloud business as it tries to compete with Mircrosoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, which are dominating that market. If history is any indication, that cost should be a pretty good part of its overall costs, and this quarter’s figures will reveal whether those costs are increasing or not., Alphabet Options Activity, Options activity has been light in both the Class A (GOOG) and Class C (GOOGL) shares. There has been some put activity at the GOOGL 1120 and 1125 strikes, but the highest concentration has been way to the upside, in the GOOGL 1200 calls. The implied volatility sits at the 41st percentile as of today., Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

Are we worth less than other engineers at this company? Do we not all deserve these same rights and freedoms?” he asked. , “My trust in Google has been replaced with fear,” Holsclaw read from a statement that he said was written by a co-worker. “Fear that I’m made complicit in the abuse of the Chinese people. Fear that my work becomes a weapon wielded in the oppression of people around the world.” , “People at the top do not understand the reality that workers and users are living in, and their own responsibility in that reality,” she said. , “Why is this company so afraid of viewpoint diversity?” the shareholder said. , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly. Previously]\", '[istock.com, Key Takeaways, This morning delivered a diversion from the steady drumbeat of earnings with an update from the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB finished its meeting today without announcing a new rate cut, but hinted strongly that one could happen in September., The ECB hasn’t cut rates since 2016, and the economy there continues to sputter. Yesterday included weak manufacturing data from Germany. Low rates in Europe can pump up the dollar vs. the euro. So anything the ECB ends up doing could have an impact on the U.S. market., A strong dollar is already causing some problems for big U.S. companies selling products overseas, and the situation got more serious early Thursday as the dollar index climbed toward 98. Just a month ago it was under 96. It hasn’t been over 98 since May., The other impact of low rates in Europe is pressure on U.S. rates. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell early Thursday to just over 2.01%, and looks like it could threaten to fall below 2% again. One reason some analysts think the Fed is likely to cut rates next week is to put them more in line with rates overseas, though U.S. borrowing costs would still be way above those in Europe., Back home, it’s been a pretty good earnings season overall, and the drumbeat continues this afternoon with two of the biggest names of all, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). So far, 75% of companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share, according to FactSet. We’re about one-third of the way through earnings season., Before hearing from AMZN and GOOGL later today, the morning papers landed at the front door with good news from 3M (MMM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and American Airlines (AAL), which all beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates. Last night saw nice results from Facebook (FB), but the brakes slammed over at Tesla (TSLA), which very much under-delivered and remains a tough one to figure out., Though TSLA missed analysts’ earnings per share projections, it did stick to its guidance for 2019 vehicle sales. The company has reported losses two quarters in a row after two quarters of profit last year, and the stock fell more than 11% in pre-market trading., While FB stock initially climbed 3% after reporting, it quickly backtracked to slight losses despite topping third-party consensus on both top and bottom lines. That kind of tepid response might reflect what we talked about earlier this week regarding how companies under regulatory scrutiny might not see strong gains even if quarterly results impress. The stock did climb again in pre-market trading., On a positive note, beer consumption is up. That’s the read from Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), which reported earnings and sales above analysts’ estimates. Beer volumes rose 2.2% in the quarter., PayPal (PYPL) beat on earnings but missed on revenue. Still, the company reported 9 million active new accounts and raised guidance. A lot of analysts upgraded the stock., Going back to MMM a minute, the company had really good earnings, and their CEO talked about great progress in the face of continued slow growth conditions. He didn’t emphasize sales as much as improved cash flow and managing costs. This could be seen as a cautionary note., In data news, June durable goods came in better than expected. The first government estimate for Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) comes tomorrow., If there’s a predictable thing about the markets, it’s that they often act unpredictably. Wednesday’s action was a good example., For instance, crude prices crumbled despite a huge weekly draw out of U.S. stockpiles. The Technology sector performed pretty well even though just the day before the government announced a Department of Justice investigation that might affect some of the sector’s biggest firms., At the same time, earnings continued to offer people their choice of what company’s lens they want to view things through. This is a conundrum for all market participants now. Which signal do you look at to say how the market is doing?, For instance, do you look at Caterpillar, whose quarter ran into a China roadblock, and say China is a big problem going forward and that’s the main story for the market?, Or do you see it through the lens of Texas Instruments (TXN), which had a fantastic quarter all around and helped the Semiconductor sector throw a Wall Street party Wednesday? Some analysts see the chip market as a barometer of global growth, so if chip companies do well, doesn’t that mean things are generally OK? It all depends on how you look at things., Still, we aren’t completely through the chip industry reporting season, with Intel (INTC) earnings still ahead and that company often offering a different take on the sector. That’s why it’s too soon to say the chip sector has bottomed. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose more than 3% Wednesday., Another lens to look through comes from Visa (V), whose earnings beat expectations for every aspect of the business. This brings us back to the consumer, who ultimately seems to be driving the current stock market rally., One thing predictable thing about Wednesday was the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s ($DJI) underperformance compared with the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP). Disappointing earnings results from $DJI components Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) had a lot to do with that, but even there you had a little bit of unpredictability because most of the big financial stocks rose despite declining rates., Speaking of unpredictable markets, U.S. crude stocks fell more than 10 million barrels in the most recent weekly update from the government, but crude pulled back sharply Wednesday.\\xa0 It looks like analysts shook off the report by saying it reflected lower production and imports due to the hurricane a couple weeks ago. If you look at the U.S. crude chart over the last month, $55 a barrel has been a pretty clear support point, and the market bounced again late Wednesday after falling below $56., One thing finding almost no support this week is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which descended down toward 12 on Wednesday and seems to be getting ready for its summer slumber. The last two summers saw VIX spend a lot of time under 12. The VIX fell under 12 intraday Wednesday for the first time since mid-April. It had climbed well over 20 back in May., It’s hard to see that happening this year considering all the China trade and Brexit worries, but the agreement this week between Congress and the White House to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government opened might have helped lower the volatility volume a little for now. Also, earnings being a little stronger than many analysts had expected might be calming things down a bit., The wild card for volatility, besides those geopolitical factors, might end up being the Fed. While futures prices have baked in a 25-basis point rate cut next week, there’s uncertainty about what comes next (see more below). If the Fed throws a curveball in its statement or press conference, we could see VIX roar back., FIGURE 1: VIX SUMMER SNOOZE? The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX - candlestick) fell to its lowest levels since mid-April and went below 12 at one point, down from above 20 back in May. VIX’s decline coincided with a record-high close for the S&amp;P 500 (purple line), and might also reflect declining worries about earnings and Washington politics. Data Source: Cboe Global Markets, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results., One thing that could work its way into the Fed’s playbook is gross domestic product (GDP)., The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow meter predicts 1.6% growth in Q2, and many Wall Street analysts don’t see much of a comeback in Q3 and Q4. However, if GDP starts to look better than expected, that could mean the Fed starts to push back on calls for another rate cut after this month. If the Fed vocally pushes back in either its statement or at Powell’s press conference next week, that could potentially change the bullish feelings around the stock market a bit., The Fed is likely to provide a look next week at its own projections for growth in the second half, and tomorrow brings the government’s first look at Q2 GDP growth. Analysts see growth of just 1.8%, according to Briefing.com, which would be the lowest since Q1 of 2017 and down from 3.1% in Q1. A Wall Street Journal analyst survey shows average GDP estimates of under 2% for the final two quarters of this year, as well., New home sales for June also came in below expectations, with downward adjustments to the April and May numbers. “Overall sales activity remains tepid despite the fundamental supports of low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and a tight supply of existing homes for sale,” Briefing.com noted. Maybe investors can get a better sense of demand for new homes next week when homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) before the Tuesday’s open., TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

I am writing this column in Google Docs using a Chromebook and will proofread it on my Android phone using Chrome and then forward it to my social networks through that browser with an additional distribution to select contacts via my Gmail influencers' mailing list. \\xa0That is five degrees of engagement for one column. It is an extraordinary level of customer contact. It also may be too much., New York, USA- 11 May 2019: Google office near Chelsea market. Google is one of top search engine in the world which first start its business in California., Who decides how much is too much? \\xa0It would be refreshing if that answer were anything other than “government,” but, sadly, that is the reality of the situation. \\xa0It is not just one government, of course, as Google has had multiple run-ins with European regulators--including the imposition of a 1.49 billion euro fine in March--as well as its 2013 antitrust case versus the Justice Department, widely heralded as a victory for the tech company. \\xa0This ignores China, where google.com is blocked, although some have access to its search capabilities through Virtual Private Networks. The smoke signals from Mountain View are not easy to read regarding China, but one could easily paint a scenario in which Google gradually eases its way into search activities on the mainland, thereby adding another 1.3 billion users to its ecosystem., The issue driving the decline in\\xa0Alphabet shares isn’t the potential for new customers, though, it is the possibility that the U.S government could hamper the company’s ability to have such a multifaceted hold on current customers. \\xa0, Break up Google!, How much would that hurt Alphabet shareholders? \\xa0Well, first, let me clear up some confusion about the composition of that shareholder base. \\xa0Alphabet has three classes of stock:, Class A (GOOGL): these shares hold one voting right. \\xa0There were 299.4 million Class A shares outstanding as of March 31st, 2019., Class B (no public market) these shares hold ten voting rights. \\xa0Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page owned a combined 84.2% of the B shares as of December 31st, 2018, giving them 51.2% of the total votes, effectively controlling Alphabet. \\xa0There were 46.5 million B shares outstanding as of March 31st., Class C (GOOG). \\xa0These shares hold no voting rights. \\xa0There were 340.7 million Class C shares outstanding as of March 31st. , So, even though Page and Brin continue to control Alphabet, the A shares (GOOGL) do give investors a seat at the Board table, and thus could be expected to command a slight premium to the C shares. \\xa0In today’s trading that premium is about $2 per share, though, a negligible amount on the base of a $1,030 stock. , So, the choice between owning GOOG or GOOGL is really an academic one. \\xa0The choice of whether to own Alphabet or not, though, rests on exogenous factors, as seen by today’s plummet in both GOOG and GOOGL., Obviously there is a wide range of potential outcomes from potential DOJ action against Alphabet, but the worst case scenario is that Google becomes, essentially, a regulated utility. \\xa0That would be catastrophic for shareholders, given the low valuations accorded such regulated entities. A more likely outcome from regulation would be a market revaluation of Alphabet into a slow-growth, highly-profitable company that does not pay a dividend, although certainly has the means to do so., The description would have fit Apple five years ago, but of course the Cupertino giant has become proactive in returning money to shareholders. \\xa0In Silicon Valley, though, that can be seen as a sign that growth prospects are waning., Apple currently receives a P/E ratio of 15.2x fiscal 2019 earnings. \\xa0Even after today’s pasting, Alphabet shares are still getting a 21.2x estimated 2019 earnings. \\xa0Another valuation method--and always the default setting for those of us who worked as sell-side analysts following industrials--is to throw up one’s hands while attempting to value a growth-challenged company and say “just give it a market multiple.” \\xa0\\xa0According to FactSet, the S&amp;P 500’s current forward P/E is 15.9x 2019 EPS., So, based on Wall Street’s current consensus EPS estimate of $48.44 for Alphabet in 2019, an Apple multiple would imply a fair price for Alphabet of $736 per share and a market multiple would imply a fair price of $770 per share. \\xa0, The numbers don’t lie. \\xa0If indeed the innocence has ended for Google, Alphabet shares have more than 25% downside from current levels. \\xa0Be careful. , I have researched stocks for 27 years, starting fresh out of college at Lehman Brothers and then moving to Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette. At DLJ I was a Senior Analyst ...]\", \"[Should you buy or sell Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet., Before we jump into the Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet, let’s start with the much broader technology index, the Nasdaq 100. I’m going to go so far as to say that as excited as we should be about the broader market making new highs, we need to look a bit more closely at the chain of events., It was, in fact, the Nasdaq 100 that first broke through the October 2018 high on April 17th as opposed to the S&amp;P 500 that took till April 29th, almost two weeks later. It might be argued that technology was the leader, and the rest of the market, the follower., That said, from my personal experience, I have noticed an interesting relationship between new highs and the strength of stocks. In addition, I am further convinced when I consider this data-driven relationship in context, in the sense that the thesis is logical. Namely, that the demonstration of eagerness amongst buyers that push up a thing so aggressively that it reaches new heights seems to reasonably suggest that there’s something special about it. Likewise, if buyers push up one group of stocks before another group, it seems logically consistent with the crowd preferring the first group! The reasonability is compelling., And Alphabet is the most interesting one, having surpassed its Oct 2018 level as early as March 20th (a sign of strength as the first one to break through that particular gate), and then making a new all-time high on the very same day as the S&amp;P 500. But then it gave back significantly with a disappointing earnings reports, dropping about 7% on April 30th to land up back below its October 2018 levels., These are all interesting data points, but let’s not get into the nitty-gritty. Instead, let’s just step back and recognize the big picture, that none of these are keeping up with either the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. Outside of their independent nuances, this is the troubling fact, the perceived leaders are acting like laggards. Clearly, they are not the ones that the crowd is heaving themselves at., Once establishing “person of interest” status, the next thing to do is to start looking deeper, with a slight tilt toward skepticism given the existing status. After establishing person of interest status, the detective's job is to assess more clues that align with the working theory, and where possible, more conclusive evidence. We need to do the same., For example, Apple was sharp, from October to the December low it is straight down, and from that bottom, straight up; like a perfect “V” (although the right side not having reached the top of the left side). This, to me, demonstrates panic; panic to get out, and then once at a low enough level, a panic to get in. Apple has been the darling, so both buyers and sellers panic. And while the seller side is not so great, the buyer panic (of missing out) is definitely a good sign. But, then again, with all that panic to get into Apple from the bottom, it couldn’t even make it to its old high. Hhmmm., In contrast, from its December 2018 low, Amazon just moved sideways for a while. From January 1 to mid-March, it went nowhere, just stuck range bound while it was making a decision. After it broke out on the upside in mid-March and continued with a healthy uptrend ever since we came to know that those prior months were consolidation; wherein market participants were patiently and thoughtfully consolidating their position, and their thoughts. This is methodical and I like it., Lastly, Alphabet moved with similar intensity and sharpness to Apple, albeit not quite as rigorously. The difference is that Apple sold off 35%, so had further to recover, whereas Alphabet lost only 25% during the Q4 2018 correction, so had less to recover in 2019. More so, the 2019 uptrend included both some pullbacks and some consolidation, making its way up in a step-like fashion; aggressive but methodical. And then, unlike the others, achieved new highs., With all these ideas in mind, if I had to choose, I would buy Alphabet. I look at the gap down a few days ago as a buying opportunity., And as for the other two, because they are so close, I’d wait to see if they get through their all-time highs. These levels may show resistance, but whether they do or don’t, there’s no reason not to wait and see whether this unknown transforms into a known.

But all this selling is short-sighted., The Mountain View, Calif., company has always been an accidental ad seller. Its real business is machine learning.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu), The point of inflection is near, and investors should buy this dip., He was speaking at the eMerge Americas conference in April. Talking about the red-hot cloud computing market, Polit told a story very much outside the current mainstream narrative., For now, anyway …, The strategy is at a crossroads. The company needs to prioritize what investments will best advance its digital transformation., Jargon aside, McDonald wants to use AI to inform everything from how the company creates molecules for soaps and lotions, to how it interacts with customers., He also wants to use data to find business models that might not otherwise be obvious., Only one leading cloud infrastructure company has its roots in machine learning and AI.\\xa0And that’s Alphabet., Google, as a company, began as a grad project in the halls of Stanford in 1998. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had the bright idea they could design algorithms to manage the world’s public information more effectively., As a way to navigate the web, Google came out of nowhere. Unlike Yahoo!, Lycos and Alta Vista, the popular search engines at the time, it used math that prioritized how often internet pages were linked., PageRank was never intended to be the basis for the biggest advertising platform the world has ever known. Hawking ads paid the bills. Google began as a math problem for curious grad students. It was refined with algorithms, massive amounts of data and computer power., Teaching computers to learn and provide insights using data is what Google does., Then, in 2014, the company acquired DeepMind Technologies, a British AI startup that was making progress teaching computers the quirks of human short-term memory., A few years later, its custom AlphaGo code was so advanced that it became the first computer program to defeat a human in a match of Go, the ancient Chinese strategy game., Go is renowned among computer scientists because it stretches the limits of human general intelligence. AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, the 18-time Go world champion, 4-1., Now Alphabet is making a pitch to enterprises.\\xa0Managers at Google Cloud want to use the corporate pedigree, and undisputed AI leadership, to help companies build new business models using data analytics and AI. You can see how that might appeal to large enterprises struggling to stay one step ahead of the next Amazon.com., Google Cloud replaced Diane Greene with Amit Zavery as chief executive officer in November 2018. Zavery, a top ex-Oracle product manager, is a nuts-and-bolts sales guy. He has been aggressively building out a sales operation to court enterprise CIOs., It all fits with Polit’s view from inside P&amp;G. The company signed its first deal with Google Cloud in early April. However, Polit says P&amp;G’s cloud spend could shift more toward Google over the next 18-24 months as data mining begins to play a bigger role in the future of the business., At this stage, Google Cloud is not a material part of Alphabet’s business.\\xa0Its specific numbers are mixed with “other” sales in the company regulatory filings., However, the future is bright. After two decades, Alphabet finally has another use case for its core skillset in machine learning and AI., Alphabet shares got smashed Tuesday, losing 7.5% on the revenue shortfall. And Wednesday saw the stock lose another roughly 2% despite general positivity in the broad market after the release of new data showing strong private-sector hiring in April, a handful of upbeat earnings reports, and the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged., Shares now trade at 21.9x forward earnings.

Sales in this so-called Other Revenues category swelled 25% year over year to $5.4 billion. , “Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet,” chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on the company’s earnings call. , Porat also added that lower hardware sales offset Other Revenues growth, including slow sales of its high-end Pixel devices. In addition to the Pixel phones, the company sells a line of smart speakers, which compete with Amazon’s Alexa devices and Apple’s Homepod as well as other tablets and smartphones. , On the earnings call, Bank of America’s Justin Post expressed skepticism about the success of Google’s hardware investment, which CEO Sundar Pichai described as in its “early days.”   , “There’s some concerns that it’s not getting off to a strong trajectory,” Post said. , A bright spot in the report was that Google traffic acquisition costs, which includes what it pays to phone manufacturers like Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, decreased from the prior quarter to\\xa0$6.86 billion, which was less than the $7.26 billion analysts expected. , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly. Previously]', '[There is a theory that the Greeks developed their alphabet around the same time they wrote down Homer. They saw the need to preserve the Iliad and the Odyssey and to spread these epic poems as widely as possible. Up till then, poetry had been an oral tradition, a performance, and writing made it possible to transmit Homer to faraway places and to the future as well, which is far away in time. The forms of the letters go all the way back to the Phoenicians, and the first two letters, alpha beta, which came into English from Greek through Latin, have not changed in all that time. That the alphabet has survived, in one form or another, for so long is a testament to its usefulness and durability—to the genius of it., The Phoenician alphabet was all consonants. The innovation of the Greeks was that they used some of the symbols for vowels. This made the written language more expressive—it put the human soul into it. In order to speak, we need to breathe out, exhale, and make sounds using our throats and the resonant chambers in our heads as well as our lips and teeth and tongue. The vowels are the breath of the alphabet—they could be said to carry the human voice. They sing. In our time, email was an innovation, and before that the fax machine, and before that the telegraph (the Twitter of its time). The evolution of the alphabet as a way to record human speech was the beginning of civilization, in a way. This supple group of 24 symbols (in the Greek alphabet; the Roman alphabet has 26) made it possible for humankind to address the future and look back at the past. The other thing I think is amazing about the invention of writing is that it was originally done on clay, so it is as if we inscribed poetry into the earth itself., Quora: The best answer to any question.]', '[istock.com, After two sessions of records, it remains to be seen whether the momentum will continue amid mixed earnings and data showing slowing Chinese factory growth., On the earnings front, shares of Google’s parent Alphabet were down more than 7% in pre-market trading after the internet search giant reported revenue that missed expectations., The company has been facing pressure from increased competition in online advertising, and this most recent quarter saw Google’s year-on-year advertising revenue growth slow to around 15% compared to roughly 24% in Q1 2018., In events since its last quarterly report, the company was hit with a roughly $1.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission over what the commission said was abuse of its dominant position in the market. That’s the third massive fine for the company from the European Union in about three years, totaling about $9.4 billion., But not all was doom-and-gloom in earnings news. General Electric, McDonald’s, Merck, and Pfizer all surpassed Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue., They form the latest round of companies to best forecasts during this earnings season, which has been marked by low expectations. The fact that many companies that have reported so far have beaten expectations is one reason the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have posted record closes for two sessions in a row., Another leg of support this year has come from a dovish Fed. The central bank starts its two-day policy setting meeting today. While policy makers are widely expected to leave the central bank’s key short-term interest rate unchanged, market participants are likely to try to glean insights into the Fed’s thinking on the economy and interest rate trajectory from comments accompanying the decision., One headwind for the market this morning is economic data out of China. The nation’s official April purchasing managers index surprisingly dipped. Meanwhile a private business survey also disappointed., The data underscore fears of slowing economic growth in the world’s second-largest economy even as optimism about a potential trade deal between the Asian nation and the United States has been another leg of support for the market, as has recent robust U.S. economic data., In a performance akin to Friday’s, the market rose to new records Monday after strong economic data., Figures from the Commerce Department showed U.S. personal spending jumped 0.9% in March, ahead of a rise of 0.8% that had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus. But during the same period, core personal consumption expenditures, which are the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in below a Briefing.com consensus expectation for a 0.1% rise. (See more below.), The strong reading on consumer spending amid low inflation appeared to encourage investors about the state of the U.S. economy, especially after a surprisingly strong gross domestic product (GDP) figure last week., That sentiment appeared to cause some investors and traders to move out of the relative safety of U.S. government debt. Amid the selling, the yields, which move inversely to prices, on the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year Treasury bond rose., The rising yields helped the Financials sector rise more than 0.9%, making it the day’s biggest gainer. Banks tend to do better when longer-term yields are greater than shorter-term ones. That way they can earn more money on the interest they charge on loans than they have to pay out on deposits., On the flip side of the coin, the rising yields helped pressure Real Estate and Utilities. These two sectors are often considered bond proxies because of their history of stable payouts., When government bonds, which are considered safer than stocks, rise, that means more competition for these bond proxies, and investors can switch out of them and move into bonds. Also, for Real Estate, higher interest rates can crimp demand by making mortgages more expensive and properties less affordable., Monday offered a pretty classic Investment 101 scenario of investors and traders moving into stocks and out of bonds as they appeared to feel more bullish and perhaps wanted to not get left behind if momentum buying really stepped up., This FOMO (fear of missing out) trade helped send the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to record intraday and closing highs, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed higher., But the day’s gains weren’t all that impressive in percentage terms, ranging from a gain of 0.04% for the Dow to 0.19% for the Nasdaq. It seems that the buying momentum was kept in check by uncertainty surrounding a busy week ahead., In addition to continued earnings reports and the Fed meeting, U.S.-China trade negotiations that may be nearing a conclusion are continuing, and a widely-anticipated jobs report is scheduled for Friday morning., Figure 1: Lackluster: Gold futures dropped Monday. The decline came after the strong consumer spending data apparently dulled gold’s allure as a safe-haven investment. At the same time, a subdued inflation reading also likely pressured the metal, which is often considered a hedge against inflation. Data Source: CME Group.

Twenty-five years later, the position has gone from a good idea to a near necessity for enterprises with complex infrastructures and compliance standards.\\xa0, Whenever I talk about my job, whether it’s at a speaking engagement or in a one-on-one conversation, eventually someone asks me what it’s like being a CISO for a cyber security company. The short answer is that it’s always interesting. The longer, more accurate response is that it requires the ability to see things from different perspectives.\\xa0, Generally, CISOs have a standard set of functions, ranging from creating security policies to managing their company’s security operations. I also build and lead the execution of our compliance strategy as well as writing policy and working with IT and engineering teams. However, those are internal tasks. When your company is in the business of selling security products to other businesses, your job expands to include external responsibilities.\\xa0, On a typical day (not that you have many of those), you may spend your morning working internal compliance strategies for your new products. As part of that process, you’re likely interacting with your sales team as if you’re a prospect or a customer. CISOs frequently get pitched by outside vendors, but hearing how your company’s team pitches your own products offers an interesting peek behind the curtain.\\xa0\\xa0, After you’re done meeting with the sales team, you could be asked to provide a customer or prospect with proof that they can add your product to their digital environment without disrupting security or business. It’s interesting to hear how our large customers are applying new policy to their own network. I often take those ideas and build them into our internal policies and push them down to our vendors., Developing Mitigation Strategies, You could also get called on to find specific use cases to support sales. Advocating for your own product rather than reviewing an outside product is one pretty major difference between being a CISO at a security company and holding the same job somewhere else., The size of your organization also matters when it comes to day-to-day job responsibilities.\\xa0 CISOs for larger security vendors may have a compliance staff who would handle that side of things. If that’s the case, you should get to know that group as well, because they will bring a different angle of understanding to the various things you’re meant to be protecting.\\xa0\\xa0, CISOs at smaller companies or startups probably need to take a more hands-on approach. In my case, that includes leading a research team dedicated to understanding network threats and creating detection and mitigation strategies to help our customers.\\xa0, Building a Security-Forward Culture, Being a CISO is both challenging and rewarding, no matter where you work. You will get to team up with incredibly talented and creative people. You can help create a culture in which people realize security is everyone’s responsibility.\\xa0, Jeff Costlow is the CISO at ExtraHop.

(GOOGL) shares have been on a rip this year, up about 21.5% year to date as of April 24, versus a 17% rise in the S&amp;P 500 (SPX). The search engine giant is scheduled to release Q1 results after the closing bell April 29., As one of the FAANGs, which include Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), Google is a kind of bellwether for big players in the technology sector. For much of 2018, FAANGs’ momentum helped drive a solid rally for much of the year, and then played a large role in Q4’s steep losses. So far this year, FAANGs have had a lesser role in the more-broad-based rally, but their positive drive has certainly also contributed., GOOGL itself doesn’t provide quarterly guidance, but the Street expects it to report Q1 adjusted EPS of $10.56, down from $13.33 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $37.33 billion, up 19.9% from a year ago., Digital Advertising Revenue Hit Plateau in Q4, In Q4, GOOGL shares slid about 3% after it reported rising costs and a decline in advertising prices, where it gleans a good deal of revenue. Its core advertising revenue grew 20% to $32.6 billion, which was about the same rate of growth it saw in Q3, meaning that line of business had hit a bit of a plateau. Meanwhile, the costs for traffic acquisition, for example what it pays to other companies to be a default search engine, climbed 15% year over year to $7.44 billion., Still, GOOGL showed it continued to expand its hardware sales and cloud business, and earnings and revenue topped Street estimates. Q4 revenue was $39.3 billion, up 22% from the year prior, and earnings were $12.77 per share, up 12% year over year., Its “other revenue,” which includes Google Play, hardware and cloud computing, increased 31% year over year to $6.49 billion, although the company did not break down that number to show exactly where the growth came from. CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call that Google Cloud was one of the company’s “fastest-growing business segments.” He also said the company “more than doubled” the number of Cloud Platform deals over $1 million and the number of multi-year contracts, although he didn’t provide specifics., “Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge and one that is constantly getting harder,” Pichai said., In events since its last quarterly report, GOOGL was hit with a roughly $1.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission over what the commission said was abuse of its dominant position in the market. GOOGL is accounting for the entire fine in the first quarter, so that will reduce its earnings and operating income, as well as its net income. That’s the third massive fine for GOOGL from the EU in about three years, totaling about $9.4 billion, so investors are likely hoping its regulatory headaches are over soon., GOOGL Options Activity, The options market has priced in about a 3.6% stock move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, For the May 3 options expiration, volume has been light overall. Put options have been most active at the 1230 strike. On the call side, the 1300 strike has been the most active, followed by the 1310 strike.

Although Sidewalk Labs announced its ambitions to bid for Toronto\\'s redevelopment in 2017, this is the first document that fully lays out its ultimate vision, which includes proposals for two neighborhoods—Quayside and Villiers West—as well as a larger Innovative Development and Economic Acceleration (IDEA) district., Dan Doctoroff, the CEO of the Alphabet subsidiary and a former deputy mayor of New York City, touted the plan as a “groundbreaking blueprint for the neighborhood of the future” that is environmentally friendly and built for people of all income levels. Residential units make up 67% of the planned development in the main Quayside district, for example, with 40% at below-market prices, and Sidewalk promises 1,700 affordable housing units in all. , “We think it’s the first true articulation of what’s really possible when you combine cutting-edge innovation and forward-looking urban design to produce an inclusive community,” Doctoroff said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. , Sidewalk has stipulated the creation of an independent Civic Data Trust to handle digital governance issues and has also committed not to sell personal information, not to use personal information for advertising and not to disclose information to third parties without explicit consent., Waterfront Toronto said in a statement that based on a read-through of the plans, it will require additional information to establish whether the initial proposals are in compliance with applicable laws and its own data principles. , Doctoroff said that Sidewalk would continue to work closely with the government and community groups to move its plan forward and described the process as “like a 50-sided Rubik\\'s cube.” , The master plan outlines a capital-intensive investment for Sidewalk, though also one that could potentially be incredibly lucrative. At this point, Alphabet’s subsidiary companies like Sidewalk, called its “Other Bets,” have generated very little revenue. In the company’s most recent quarterly earnings, the “Other Bets” reported losses of $868 million and $170 million in revenue. , For much more detail, check out the planning documents below: , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly.

A California arbitration panel reviewing Waymo’s claim against Anthony Levandowski, the former Google and Uber engineer who sparked their high-profile 2017 fight over trade secrets, determined on March 26 that he is on the hook for a $127 million award to Waymo. Uber, which acquired Levandowski’s company and brought him in to oversee its self-driving car project, said it’s contesting whether it’s obligated to pay some or all of that potential settlement, which may also include court and legal fees. , Additionally, an independent software investigator brought in to assess whether Uber’s driverless car system used any technology originating from Waymo found “certain functions in our autonomous vehicle software that are problematic and other functions that are not,” Uber said. , “If these interim findings become final, they could result in a license fee or in design changes that could require substantial time and resources to implement, and could limit or delay our production of autonomous vehicle technologies,” Uber said in the filing. , The review continues, and Waymo said in an emailed statement that it “will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our confidential information is not being used by Uber.”, Alphabet shows up a handful of times in the risks section of Uber’s filing. In addition to the mapping example, Uber also cites its reliance on Google’s app store, Play, and Apple’s App Store, as a risk, writing that it can’t guarantee that the two companies won’t start charging fees to download its app. Waymo is name-dropped as a competitor, too, along with a host of other companies working on self-driving capabilities. , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly.

I also believe it is the future of our world—smart cities, connected people, and hopefully, a climate-positive conscious that gives more back to the earth than it takes. However, I do agree with critics that it is far too early to endorse Alphabet’s data security plan. There is too much we don’t know—and the outcomes are too great to gamble without further details and commitment to resident privacy and security., I am a principal analyst of Futurum Research and CEO of Broadsuite Media Group. I spend my time researching, analyzing and providing the world’s best and brightest compa...', 'Google CEO Sundar Pichai , Alphabet’s stock soared nearly 9% after-hours as the company beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line in its second-quarter earnings and announced plans for a $25 billion buyback of its Class C stock. , As usual, most of Alphabet’s revenue came from Google’s advertising sales (nearly 84%) though it also showed strong growth in its burgeoning cloud business. The company reported advertising revenue of $32.6 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase, while its so-called Other Revenues category, which includes cloud computing and its hardware efforts, hit $6.18 billion, or a nearly 40% increase year-over-year. , Meanwhile, Alphabet reported that its longer term efforts—like autonomous vehicle unit Waymo and healthcare company Verily, among others—posted revenues of $162 million (up from $145 million the previous year) on losses of $989 million (an increase from $732 million the previous year). Although those “Other Bets” have consistently lost money, investors see them as the as the key to the company’s future beyond advertising. , “It’s important that we stay focused on building helpful products for users,” he said. , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly. Previously', \"If the entire earnings season got stuffed into one day, we’d be just about done with breakfast., It’s been a nutritious one, with 79% of reporting companies coming in above expectations so far, according to FactSet. Still, lunch and dinner have to be served, and this week features about 25% of all S&amp;P 500 companies sharing results. Things got off to a mixed start with energy firm Halliburton (HAL) reporting earnings per share that beat expectations but coming up short on revenue., Earnings are roughly 15% finished, and optimism is starting to build that maybe things can turn out a little better than the goose egg many people had expected. That could help explain why stocks have a positive tone this morning. By the end of this Friday, 40% of earnings will be done, and we’ll have to wait and see what the tone is like by then., Something else to consider keeping an eye on this week is the situation in Washington, D.C. The House is set to go on recess after Friday, and there’s still no budget deal. If that doesn’t get straightened out, worries could build about a possible government shutdown and the debt ceiling, which the Treasury secretary said last week needs to be raised., One more thing to keep in mind as the week moves along is the European Central Bank (ECB), which has a rate decision scheduled for Thursday. An interest rate cut might be in the cards, analysts said, or at least some sort of new stimulus., Iran Worries Still Simmering, Last week sputtered to a close as geopolitics sailed back into the picture. News at midday Friday that Iran seized a British tanker appeared to stir up some waves, and the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) sank back after its early gains. The tanker situation hasn't been resolved as of Monday morning, and that might be part of what’s giving crude a 2% boost. There’s growing concern about potential supply disruptions to the energy-rich Persian Gulf., Going back to Friday, it looked like one of those times when the market’s been up a lot recently and people decided to take some risk off the table going into the weekend. What’s interesting is how crude only rose about $1 on the Iran news and volatility didn’t get much of a lift, at least initially. However, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)—the most closely watched “fear indicator”—did begin to climb more as Friday’s session advanced, finishing above 14. It had spent much of last week below 13., The tension with Iran is a reminder that outside events continue to play a role, and that goes beyond the obvious trade battle with China. U.S. stocks are arguably priced for perfection up here near all-time highs as investors anticipate a rate cut by the end of this month. However, a shaky first week of earnings, growing Brexit concerns, and a debt limit battle shaping up in Congress all could stand in the way of continued gains. So could any bad news on the China trade front or if the tensions with Iran get worse., Miss on Earnings? Get Punished, With the first full week of earnings season behind us, the prediction made before earnings started appears to hold true for reporting companies: If you beat, you may be mildly rewarded, but if you miss, you are likely to get pounded. It’s the biggest overall trend, and we saw it with Netflix (NFLX) and CSX (CSX) both taking a beating when they came up short, and Microsoft (MSFT) and some of the bank stocks only getting slight lifts when they surpassed expectations., Last week's batch of corporate earnings also appeared to show that consumers are spending money, but companies have a wide range of potential problems heading into the second half of the year. Industrial companies are likely to continue dealing with the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, and the market’s collective eye could also be focused on slowing growth for some key manufacturing data all around the world. Some of this could show up in earnings., This week, investors are likely to focus on projections from chipmakers and what social media company executives have to say about the impact of government inquiries into privacy issues. Some of the key companies reporting this week include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), Ford (F), AT&amp;T (T), and Twitter (TWTR)., Silence is Golden This Week at the Fed, Though earnings pick up later this week, Fed speakers go into a short hibernation as the silent period begins ahead of next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. There was a lot of scuttlebutt late last week after New York Fed President John Williams appeared to hint at a half-point rate cut, but that anticipation kind of dwindled Friday when the New York Fed walked back those comments, saying they were “academic” and not necessarily related to the meeting ahead., The new week begins with CME Group futures showing investors firmly in the camp of expecting just a 25-basis point cut, with approximately 75% odds of that. Falling hopes for a 50-point cut might also have weighed on stocks toward the end of Friday’s session. A 75% chance doesn’t guarantee a 25-point cut, but typically a percentage this high so close to a meeting has proven correct in the past., Looking at the data picture, existing and new home sales for June both come out early this week, but things get more exciting Friday when the government delivers its first estimate for U.S. Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) growth. At this point, analysts look for growth of just 1.8%, according to a consensus estimate from Briefing.com. That’s down from 3.1% in Q1, and would be the lowest quarterly GDP growth since Q1 of 2017., As economic growth slows, U.S. Treasury yields just can’t get it going. The 10-year yield finished the old week under 2.06% after climbing above 2.1% a few days earlier. These geopolitical tensions wouldn’t seem likely to help yields much, as situations like this often send investors fleeing into what they see as “defensive” investments like Treasuries (yields move in the opposite direction of the underlying Treasury note)., However, if investors were feeling cautious Friday, they didn’t show it through their choice of sectors. The so-called “defensive” sectors like Real Estate and Utilities were some of the worst performers of the day, while Industrials and Energy were among the few to rise., On the plus side, transport stocks kept gaining Friday as another solid earnings report came in, this time from KC Southern (KSU). That followed strong Union Pacific (UNP) results earlier in the week and raised hopes that trains and trucks remain full of goods, which can signal healthy economic demand. An earnings beat from American Express (AXP) late last week fell into the same category. The latest University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report out Friday for early July rose from June., STOCKS AND GOLD IN SYNC: Stocks (SPX - candlestick) and gold (/GC - purple line) spent parts of last week moving together, with both reaching significant highs recently. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, which could be favorable for gold and stock prices, which don’t always rally together. Data Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results., NVR Inc. (NVR)—up 45% year to date and one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S.—reported quarterly results Friday that beat revenue and earnings expectations. The company’s new home orders increased 6%, but the average price of those homes declined, showing the market may be favoring less expensive homes over luxury homes lately. Next up for signs of how homebuilders are faring, consider watching for PulteGroup (PHM) earnings before the opening bell tomorrow., As one analyst pointed out on CNBC, you don’t even have to go too far back to find the last time a relief rally occurred for a stock in the case of bad news people had expected. Facebook (FB) shares rose earlier this month after FB got fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its privacy practices. Does all this mean bad news is good? Not exactly, but maybe when it comes to companies facing trouble, the lesson is to hope for the best but prepare for the worst., TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

And it was not surprising to see the stock dip as a result., Mountain View, California, USA - March 28, 2018: Google sign at Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley. Google is an American technology company., But what sellers are missing is that this business is onto something really big …, Using data, machine learning and AI, Alphabet managers are incubating vibrant new businesses with innovative business models. One or more of these will become exciting standalone businesses., Already, some smart analysts are doing sum-of-the-parts analysis, and they like what they see., Together, these parts are probably worth well over $1 trillion., It’s an important innovation hiding inside the search giant., And it couldn’t come at a better time., This subsidiary has its roots in DeepMind Technologies, a British AI startup that was making progress teaching computers the quirks of human short-term memory. In 2014, Alphabet acquired the business., Two years later, its custom AlphaGo code was so advanced that it became the first computer program to defeat a human in a match of Go, the ancient Chinese strategy game. That human happened to be 18-time world champion Lee Sedol., At the December 2018 CASP13 meeting in Mexico, DeepMind was at it again. This time, its human challengers were the brightest minds in biology., The task: predicting the shapes of proteins., The math has vexed computational biologists for the past 25 years. They have been trying to build more predictive software models for protein-folding, the process that leads to proteins taking three-dimensional shapes., For perspective, the second-place team accurately predicted only three of the 43 proteins., This does not mean Alphabet has an inside track to the next big drug discovery. It doesn’t work that way. Developing new drugs is both expensive and fraught with regulatory hurdles, patient trials and marketing expenses., But, this business opportunity is increasing those odds., Computational biologists in hoodies and jeans will build personalized drug treatments based on what they know about the patient’s individual genomic makeup. Behind the scenes, data scientists using AlphaFold-like AI will comb through algorithmic models, looking for previously unseen biomarkers., DeepMind has come out of nowhere to be a major player in that ecosystem. And it is hiding inside Alphabet shares, practically for free., The parent company stock trades at 21x forward earnings and 5.6x sales. These metrics reflect the consensus view that Alphabet is an advertising business, subject to regulatory attacks., For the record, its advertising business is terrific. The company had almost $39 billion in sales during the second quarter., And regulation is coming. It's true. However, the story of the stock is its valuable pieces. Investors are fretting a potential breakup of Alphabet. They should be embracing that possibility. It will lead to much higher stock prices as the value of its businesses come to light., I am an  investment adviser, trader, columnist and author based in Seattle. I publish or edit four daily publications: Strategic Advantage, on long-term investing;  Tra\", 'Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), a tech giant trailing the broader market, reports quarterly earnings after the closing bell July 25. Perhaps investors may get some fresh news to give the stock more momentum after a sluggish quarter these past few months., Several Wall Street analysts have cited the lack of transparency as a main concern with the company last quarter. So, maybe now executives may offer some clarity around earnings trends, whether or not there’s signs of revived growth this time around. We’ll have to see., Where Q1 Results Triggered Concerns, Last quarter, GOOGL reported earnings of $11.90 per share, higher than the $10.61 the Street expected. But its revenue of $36.34 billion, which included decelerating ad revenue, fell nearly $1 billion short of expectations. , Alphabet revenue was up 17% year over year in Q1, which is substantial, however it’s off from the more than 20% consistent revenue growth it had been seeing, including 20% growth in the year prior. Furthermore, its ad revenue grew 15%, paling in comparison to the 24% growth the year prior., It was the slowest sales growth the company has seen since 2015, but executives did not directly address the subject on its conference call. Instead, they focused on pockets of significant growth in the company such as areas of mobile search, cloud and YouTube. , Shares of GOOGL the past quarter have not been up to the torrid pace of the Technology sector. They’re up close to 9% as of July 24, whereas the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP) has gained 25% during that same time. Just before its Q1 report, GOOGL was up 24% year to date hitting record highs, so it’s losses since have been significant. Although keep in mind that shares have made some recovery in the last month., What to Consider Watching in the Numbers, One of GOOGL’s key metrics is its paid clicks, which show whether traffic volumes are growing. A larger audience can help offset any price reduction in ads. Last quarter, paid clicks were up 39% year over year, which again sounds like a lot until you consider that they were up 66% in the prior quarter and up 62% in the quarter before that. The company’s finance chief attributed the slumping growth to changes they company made in its YouTube user experience. So, keep your eye out for whether growth in paid clicks made any recover in Q2., Also, consider watching GOOGL’s traffic acquisition costs, which are mainly what it pays companies to be the default search engine or for other ways of generating traffic to its website. In recent years, the company has been able to keep this figure fairly stable, even beating analysts’ expectations last quarter when it reported $6.8 billion for the metric., Margins, which were lackluster last quarter, may also be in the spotlight. Q1 profit and operating margins shrunk as it invested more in hiring and YouTube as well as data centers. We’ll see whether those costs are continuing to balloon, or whether GOOGL has scaled back there., Finally, take a look outside of GOOGL’s main search engine business for how its other endeavors like its cloud computing, hardware businesses and new video streaming service Stadia are faring. Or maybe watch for what else it may have in the pipeline, say with driverless cars or other innovations that could drive growth., As a side note, consider digging a bit deeper to look at how much GOOGL is spending on its cloud business as it tries to compete with Mircrosoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, which are dominating that market. If history is any indication, that cost should be a pretty good part of its overall costs, and this quarter’s figures will reveal whether those costs are increasing or not., Alphabet Options Activity, Options activity has been light in both the Class A (GOOG) and Class C (GOOGL) shares. There has been some put activity at the GOOGL 1120 and 1125 strikes, but the highest concentration has been way to the upside, in the GOOGL 1200 calls. The implied volatility sits at the 41st percentile as of today., Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

Are we worth less than other engineers at this company? Do we not all deserve these same rights and freedoms?” he asked. , “My trust in Google has been replaced with fear,” Holsclaw read from a statement that he said was written by a co-worker. “Fear that I’m made complicit in the abuse of the Chinese people. Fear that my work becomes a weapon wielded in the oppression of people around the world.” , “People at the top do not understand the reality that workers and users are living in, and their own responsibility in that reality,” she said. , “Why is this company so afraid of viewpoint diversity?” the shareholder said. , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly. Previously\", 'istock.com, Key Takeaways, This morning delivered a diversion from the steady drumbeat of earnings with an update from the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB finished its meeting today without announcing a new rate cut, but hinted strongly that one could happen in September., The ECB hasn’t cut rates since 2016, and the economy there continues to sputter. Yesterday included weak manufacturing data from Germany. Low rates in Europe can pump up the dollar vs. the euro. So anything the ECB ends up doing could have an impact on the U.S. market., A strong dollar is already causing some problems for big U.S. companies selling products overseas, and the situation got more serious early Thursday as the dollar index climbed toward 98. Just a month ago it was under 96. It hasn’t been over 98 since May., The other impact of low rates in Europe is pressure on U.S. rates. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell early Thursday to just over 2.01%, and looks like it could threaten to fall below 2% again. One reason some analysts think the Fed is likely to cut rates next week is to put them more in line with rates overseas, though U.S. borrowing costs would still be way above those in Europe., Back home, it’s been a pretty good earnings season overall, and the drumbeat continues this afternoon with two of the biggest names of all, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). So far, 75% of companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share, according to FactSet. We’re about one-third of the way through earnings season., Before hearing from AMZN and GOOGL later today, the morning papers landed at the front door with good news from 3M (MMM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and American Airlines (AAL), which all beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates. Last night saw nice results from Facebook (FB), but the brakes slammed over at Tesla (TSLA), which very much under-delivered and remains a tough one to figure out., Though TSLA missed analysts’ earnings per share projections, it did stick to its guidance for 2019 vehicle sales. The company has reported losses two quarters in a row after two quarters of profit last year, and the stock fell more than 11% in pre-market trading., While FB stock initially climbed 3% after reporting, it quickly backtracked to slight losses despite topping third-party consensus on both top and bottom lines. That kind of tepid response might reflect what we talked about earlier this week regarding how companies under regulatory scrutiny might not see strong gains even if quarterly results impress. The stock did climb again in pre-market trading., On a positive note, beer consumption is up. That’s the read from Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), which reported earnings and sales above analysts’ estimates. Beer volumes rose 2.2% in the quarter., PayPal (PYPL) beat on earnings but missed on revenue. Still, the company reported 9 million active new accounts and raised guidance. A lot of analysts upgraded the stock., Going back to MMM a minute, the company had really good earnings, and their CEO talked about great progress in the face of continued slow growth conditions. He didn’t emphasize sales as much as improved cash flow and managing costs. This could be seen as a cautionary note., In data news, June durable goods came in better than expected. The first government estimate for Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) comes tomorrow., If there’s a predictable thing about the markets, it’s that they often act unpredictably. Wednesday’s action was a good example., For instance, crude prices crumbled despite a huge weekly draw out of U.S. stockpiles. The Technology sector performed pretty well even though just the day before the government announced a Department of Justice investigation that might affect some of the sector’s biggest firms., At the same time, earnings continued to offer people their choice of what company’s lens they want to view things through. This is a conundrum for all market participants now. Which signal do you look at to say how the market is doing?, For instance, do you look at Caterpillar, whose quarter ran into a China roadblock, and say China is a big problem going forward and that’s the main story for the market?, Or do you see it through the lens of Texas Instruments (TXN), which had a fantastic quarter all around and helped the Semiconductor sector throw a Wall Street party Wednesday? Some analysts see the chip market as a barometer of global growth, so if chip companies do well, doesn’t that mean things are generally OK? It all depends on how you look at things., Still, we aren’t completely through the chip industry reporting season, with Intel (INTC) earnings still ahead and that company often offering a different take on the sector. That’s why it’s too soon to say the chip sector has bottomed. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose more than 3% Wednesday., Another lens to look through comes from Visa (V), whose earnings beat expectations for every aspect of the business. This brings us back to the consumer, who ultimately seems to be driving the current stock market rally., One thing predictable thing about Wednesday was the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s ($DJI) underperformance compared with the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP). Disappointing earnings results from $DJI components Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) had a lot to do with that, but even there you had a little bit of unpredictability because most of the big financial stocks rose despite declining rates., Speaking of unpredictable markets, U.S. crude stocks fell more than 10 million barrels in the most recent weekly update from the government, but crude pulled back sharply Wednesday.  It looks like analysts shook off the report by saying it reflected lower production and imports due to the hurricane a couple weeks ago. If you look at the U.S. crude chart over the last month, $55 a barrel has been a pretty clear support point, and the market bounced again late Wednesday after falling below $56., One thing finding almost no support this week is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which descended down toward 12 on Wednesday and seems to be getting ready for its summer slumber. The last two summers saw VIX spend a lot of time under 12. The VIX fell under 12 intraday Wednesday for the first time since mid-April. It had climbed well over 20 back in May., It’s hard to see that happening this year considering all the China trade and Brexit worries, but the agreement this week between Congress and the White House to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government opened might have helped lower the volatility volume a little for now. Also, earnings being a little stronger than many analysts had expected might be calming things down a bit., The wild card for volatility, besides those geopolitical factors, might end up being the Fed. While futures prices have baked in a 25-basis point rate cut next week, there’s uncertainty about what comes next (see more below). If the Fed throws a curveball in its statement or press conference, we could see VIX roar back., FIGURE 1: VIX SUMMER SNOOZE? The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX - candlestick) fell to its lowest levels since mid-April and went below 12 at one point, down from above 20 back in May. VIX’s decline coincided with a record-high close for the S&amp;P 500 (purple line), and might also reflect declining worries about earnings and Washington politics. Data Source: Cboe Global Markets, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results., One thing that could work its way into the Fed’s playbook is gross domestic product (GDP)., The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow meter predicts 1.6% growth in Q2, and many Wall Street analysts don’t see much of a comeback in Q3 and Q4. However, if GDP starts to look better than expected, that could mean the Fed starts to push back on calls for another rate cut after this month. If the Fed vocally pushes back in either its statement or at Powell’s press conference next week, that could potentially change the bullish feelings around the stock market a bit., The Fed is likely to provide a look next week at its own projections for growth in the second half, and tomorrow brings the government’s first look at Q2 GDP growth. Analysts see growth of just 1.8%, according to Briefing.com, which would be the lowest since Q1 of 2017 and down from 3.1% in Q1. A Wall Street Journal analyst survey shows average GDP estimates of under 2% for the final two quarters of this year, as well., New home sales for June also came in below expectations, with downward adjustments to the April and May numbers. “Overall sales activity remains tepid despite the fundamental supports of low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and a tight supply of existing homes for sale,” Briefing.com noted. Maybe investors can get a better sense of demand for new homes next week when homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) before the Tuesday’s open., TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

That is five degrees of engagement for one column. It is an extraordinary level of customer contact. It also may be too much., New York, USA- 11 May 2019: Google office near Chelsea market. Google is one of top search engine in the world which first start its business in California., Who decides how much is too much?  It would be refreshing if that answer were anything other than “government,” but, sadly, that is the reality of the situation.  It is not just one government, of course, as Google has had multiple run-ins with European regulators--including the imposition of a 1.49 billion euro fine in March--as well as its 2013 antitrust case versus the Justice Department, widely heralded as a victory for the tech company.  This ignores China, where google.com is blocked, although some have access to its search capabilities through Virtual Private Networks. The smoke signals from Mountain View are not easy to read regarding China, but one could easily paint a scenario in which Google gradually eases its way into search activities on the mainland, thereby adding another 1.3 billion users to its ecosystem., The issue driving the decline in Alphabet shares isn’t the potential for new customers, though, it is the possibility that the U.S government could hamper the company’s ability to have such a multifaceted hold on current customers.  , Break up Google!, How much would that hurt Alphabet shareholders?  Well, first, let me clear up some confusion about the composition of that shareholder base.  Alphabet has three classes of stock:, Class A (GOOGL): these shares hold one voting right.  There were 299.4 million Class A shares outstanding as of March 31st, 2019., Class B (no public market) these shares hold ten voting rights.  Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page owned a combined 84.2% of the B shares as of December 31st, 2018, giving them 51.2% of the total votes, effectively controlling Alphabet.  There were 46.5 million B shares outstanding as of March 31st., Class C (GOOG).  These shares hold no voting rights.  There were 340.7 million Class C shares outstanding as of March 31st. , So, even though Page and Brin continue to control Alphabet, the A shares (GOOGL) do give investors a seat at the Board table, and thus could be expected to command a slight premium to the C shares.  In today’s trading that premium is about $2 per share, though, a negligible amount on the base of a $1,030 stock. , So, the choice between owning GOOG or GOOGL is really an academic one.  The choice of whether to own Alphabet or not, though, rests on exogenous factors, as seen by today’s plummet in both GOOG and GOOGL., Obviously there is a wide range of potential outcomes from potential DOJ action against Alphabet, but the worst case scenario is that Google becomes, essentially, a regulated utility.  That would be catastrophic for shareholders, given the low valuations accorded such regulated entities. A more likely outcome from regulation would be a market revaluation of Alphabet into a slow-growth, highly-profitable company that does not pay a dividend, although certainly has the means to do so., The description would have fit Apple five years ago, but of course the Cupertino giant has become proactive in returning money to shareholders.  In Silicon Valley, though, that can be seen as a sign that growth prospects are waning., Apple currently receives a P/E ratio of 15.2x fiscal 2019 earnings.  Even after today’s pasting, Alphabet shares are still getting a 21.2x estimated 2019 earnings.  Another valuation method--and always the default setting for those of us who worked as sell-side analysts following industrials--is to throw up one’s hands while attempting to value a growth-challenged company and say “just give it a market multiple.”   According to FactSet, the S&amp;P 500’s current forward P/E is 15.9x 2019 EPS., So, based on Wall Street’s current consensus EPS estimate of $48.44 for Alphabet in 2019, an Apple multiple would imply a fair price for Alphabet of $736 per share and a market multiple would imply a fair price of $770 per share.  , The numbers don’t lie.  If indeed the innocence has ended for Google, Alphabet shares have more than 25% downside from current levels.  Be careful. , I have researched stocks for 27 years, starting fresh out of college at Lehman Brothers and then moving to Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette. At DLJ I was a Senior Analyst ...\", \"Should you buy or sell Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet., Before we jump into the Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet, let’s start with the much broader technology index, the Nasdaq 100. I’m going to go so far as to say that as excited as we should be about the broader market making new highs, we need to look a bit more closely at the chain of events., It was, in fact, the Nasdaq 100 that first broke through the October 2018 high on April 17th as opposed to the S&amp;P 500 that took till April 29th, almost two weeks later. It might be argued that technology was the leader, and the rest of the market, the follower., That said, from my personal experience, I have noticed an interesting relationship between new highs and the strength of stocks. In addition, I am further convinced when I consider this data-driven relationship in context, in the sense that the thesis is logical. Namely, that the demonstration of eagerness amongst buyers that push up a thing so aggressively that it reaches new heights seems to reasonably suggest that there’s something special about it. Likewise, if buyers push up one group of stocks before another group, it seems logically consistent with the crowd preferring the first group! The reasonability is compelling., And Alphabet is the most interesting one, having surpassed its Oct 2018 level as early as March 20th (a sign of strength as the first one to break through that particular gate), and then making a new all-time high on the very same day as the S&amp;P 500. But then it gave back significantly with a disappointing earnings reports, dropping about 7% on April 30th to land up back below its October 2018 levels., These are all interesting data points, but let’s not get into the nitty-gritty. Instead, let’s just step back and recognize the big picture, that none of these are keeping up with either the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. Outside of their independent nuances, this is the troubling fact, the perceived leaders are acting like laggards. Clearly, they are not the ones that the crowd is heaving themselves at., Once establishing “person of interest” status, the next thing to do is to start looking deeper, with a slight tilt toward skepticism given the existing status. After establishing person of interest status, the detective's job is to assess more clues that align with the working theory, and where possible, more conclusive evidence. We need to do the same., For example, Apple was sharp, from October to the December low it is straight down, and from that bottom, straight up; like a perfect “V” (although the right side not having reached the top of the left side). This, to me, demonstrates panic; panic to get out, and then once at a low enough level, a panic to get in. Apple has been the darling, so both buyers and sellers panic. And while the seller side is not so great, the buyer panic (of missing out) is definitely a good sign. But, then again, with all that panic to get into Apple from the bottom, it couldn’t even make it to its old high. Hhmmm., In contrast, from its December 2018 low, Amazon just moved sideways for a while. From January 1 to mid-March, it went nowhere, just stuck range bound while it was making a decision. After it broke out on the upside in mid-March and continued with a healthy uptrend ever since we came to know that those prior months were consolidation; wherein market participants were patiently and thoughtfully consolidating their position, and their thoughts. This is methodical and I like it., Lastly, Alphabet moved with similar intensity and sharpness to Apple, albeit not quite as rigorously. The difference is that Apple sold off 35%, so had further to recover, whereas Alphabet lost only 25% during the Q4 2018 correction, so had less to recover in 2019. More so, the 2019 uptrend included both some pullbacks and some consolidation, making its way up in a step-like fashion; aggressive but methodical. And then, unlike the others, achieved new highs., With all these ideas in mind, if I had to choose, I would buy Alphabet. I look at the gap down a few days ago as a buying opportunity., And as for the other two, because they are so close, I’d wait to see if they get through their all-time highs. These levels may show resistance, but whether they do or don’t, there’s no reason not to wait and see whether this unknown transforms into a known. If they make it through, I would continue buying them on pullbacks. And if not, all bets are off until they get cheaper., If your investment objective is to minimize taxes, the argument against selling can be compelling. However, if your objective is to become wealthy, then holding onto a stock that has already seen its best days is a mistake., In sports, this is like betting on the San Francisco 49ers because Joe Montana led them to win four Super Bowl in the 80s. Today's 49ers are an entirely different team so the fact that they did so well in the 80s does not tell you anything about their prospects for winning the next Super Bowl., Similarly, prospects for Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet are not the same as they were 10 years ago. How you assess their current prospects should have nothing to do with how much you've made on these stocks., If these three stocks are less than 30% of your portfolio, then I'd follow Wayne's recommendation. However, if they are already more than 30% of your portfolio, I'd want to trim them back by selling into strength., I am the CEO and founder of Marketocracy, Inc.,and portfolio manager at Marketocracy Capital Management, LLC. My firm maintains a database of the world’s greatest “unkn\", 'Alphabet shareholders have had a rough month., Stock traders and analysts blame a shortfall in Alphabet’s first-quarter advertising revenues. But all this selling is short-sighted., The Mountain View, Calif., company has always been an accidental ad seller. Its real business is machine learning. And now — at long last — there is a viable, growing market for that skill set., Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during the keynote address of the Google I/O conference in Mountain View, Calif., Tuesday, May 7, 2019. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu), The point of inflection is near, and investors should buy this dip., He was speaking at the eMerge Americas conference in April. Talking about the red-hot cloud computing market, Polit told a story very much outside the current mainstream narrative., For now, anyway …, The strategy is at a crossroads. The company needs to prioritize what investments will best advance its digital transformation., Jargon aside, McDonald wants to use AI to inform everything from how the company creates molecules for soaps and lotions, to how it interacts with customers., He also wants to use data to find business models that might not otherwise be obvious., Only one leading cloud infrastructure company has its roots in machine learning and AI. And that’s Alphabet., Google, as a company, began as a grad project in the halls of Stanford in 1998. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had the bright idea they could design algorithms to manage the world’s public information more effectively., As a way to navigate the web, Google came out of nowhere. Unlike Yahoo!, Lycos and Alta Vista, the popular search engines at the time, it used math that prioritized how often internet pages were linked., PageRank was never intended to be the basis for the biggest advertising platform the world has ever known. Hawking ads paid the bills. Google began as a math problem for curious grad students. It was refined with algorithms, massive amounts of data and computer power., Teaching computers to learn and provide insights using data is what Google does., Then, in 2014, the company acquired DeepMind Technologies, a British AI startup that was making progress teaching computers the quirks of human short-term memory., A few years later, its custom AlphaGo code was so advanced that it became the first computer program to defeat a human in a match of Go, the ancient Chinese strategy game., Go is renowned among computer scientists because it stretches the limits of human general intelligence. AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, the 18-time Go world champion, 4-1., Now Alphabet is making a pitch to enterprises. Managers at Google Cloud want to use the corporate pedigree, and undisputed AI leadership, to help companies build new business models using data analytics and AI. You can see how that might appeal to large enterprises struggling to stay one step ahead of the next Amazon.com., Google Cloud replaced Diane Greene with Amit Zavery as chief executive officer in November 2018. Zavery, a top ex-Oracle product manager, is a nuts-and-bolts sales guy. He has been aggressively building out a sales operation to court enterprise CIOs., It all fits with Polit’s view from inside P&amp;G. The company signed its first deal with Google Cloud in early April. However, Polit says P&amp;G’s cloud spend could shift more toward Google over the next 18-24 months as data mining begins to play a bigger role in the future of the business., At this stage, Google Cloud is not a material part of Alphabet’s business. Its specific numbers are mixed with “other” sales in the company regulatory filings., However, the future is bright. After two decades, Alphabet finally has another use case for its core skillset in machine learning and AI., Alphabet shares got smashed Tuesday, losing 7.5% on the revenue shortfall. And Wednesday saw the stock lose another roughly 2% despite general positivity in the broad market after the release of new data showing strong private-sector hiring in April, a handful of upbeat earnings reports, and the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged., Shares now trade at 21.9x forward earnings. Given the resilience of Alphabet’s core advertising business, and the bright longer-term prospects for its cloud business, this is cheap., Based on high-teens sales growth, this stock could trade to the $1,400 level in two years.At their current price of $1,175, that’s a nice 20% potential increase for a stock with a four-digit price tag., Investors should consider using this period of momentary weakness to take positions., I am an  investment adviser, trader, columnist and author based in Seattle. I publish or edit four daily publications: Strategic Advantage, on long-term investing;  Tra', 'Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the 2019 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. , Shares of Google parent company Alphabet plunged more than 7% after hours as the company whiffed on Wall Street’s first-quarter revenue expectations. , Google is increasingly trying to diversify beyond its wildly profitable digital advertising business to costlier efforts like hardware and cloud computing. Sales in this so-called Other Revenues category swelled 25% year over year to $5.4 billion. , “Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet,” chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on the company’s earnings call. , Porat also added that lower hardware sales offset Other Revenues growth, including slow sales of its high-end Pixel devices. In addition to the Pixel phones, the company sells a line of smart speakers, which compete with Amazon’s Alexa devices and Apple’s Homepod as well as other tablets and smartphones. , On the earnings call, Bank of America’s Justin Post expressed skepticism about the success of Google’s hardware investment, which CEO Sundar Pichai described as in its “early days.”   , “There’s some concerns that it’s not getting off to a strong trajectory,” Post said. , A bright spot in the report was that Google traffic acquisition costs, which includes what it pays to phone manufacturers like Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, decreased from the prior quarter to $6.86 billion, which was less than the $7.26 billion analysts expected. , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly. Previously', 'There is a theory that the Greeks developed their alphabet around the same time they wrote down Homer. They saw the need to preserve the Iliad and the Odyssey and to spread these epic poems as widely as possible. Up till then, poetry had been an oral tradition, a performance, and writing made it possible to transmit Homer to faraway places and to the future as well, which is far away in time. The forms of the letters go all the way back to the Phoenicians, and the first two letters, alpha beta, which came into English from Greek through Latin, have not changed in all that time. That the alphabet has survived, in one form or another, for so long is a testament to its usefulness and durability—to the genius of it., The Phoenician alphabet was all consonants. The innovation of the Greeks was that they used some of the symbols for vowels. This made the written language more expressive—it put the human soul into it. In order to speak, we need to breathe out, exhale, and make sounds using our throats and the resonant chambers in our heads as well as our lips and teeth and tongue. The vowels are the breath of the alphabet—they could be said to carry the human voice. They sing. In our time, email was an innovation, and before that the fax machine, and before that the telegraph (the Twitter of its time). The evolution of the alphabet as a way to record human speech was the beginning of civilization, in a way. This supple group of 24 symbols (in the Greek alphabet; the Roman alphabet has 26) made it possible for humankind to address the future and look back at the past. The other thing I think is amazing about the invention of writing is that it was originally done on clay, so it is as if we inscribed poetry into the earth itself., Quora: The best answer to any question.', 'istock.com, After two sessions of records, it remains to be seen whether the momentum will continue amid mixed earnings and data showing slowing Chinese factory growth., On the earnings front, shares of Google’s parent Alphabet were down more than 7% in pre-market trading after the internet search giant reported revenue that missed expectations., The company has been facing pressure from increased competition in online advertising, and this most recent quarter saw Google’s year-on-year advertising revenue growth slow to around 15% compared to roughly 24% in Q1 2018., In events since its last quarterly report, the company was hit with a roughly $1.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission over what the commission said was abuse of its dominant position in the market. That’s the third massive fine for the company from the European Union in about three years, totaling about $9.4 billion., But not all was doom-and-gloom in earnings news. General Electric, McDonald’s, Merck, and Pfizer all surpassed Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue., They form the latest round of companies to best forecasts during this earnings season, which has been marked by low expectations. The fact that many companies that have reported so far have beaten expectations is one reason the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have posted record closes for two sessions in a row., Another leg of support this year has come from a dovish Fed. The central bank starts its two-day policy setting meeting today. While policy makers are widely expected to leave the central bank’s key short-term interest rate unchanged, market participants are likely to try to glean insights into the Fed’s thinking on the economy and interest rate trajectory from comments accompanying the decision., One headwind for the market this morning is economic data out of China. The nation’s official April purchasing managers index surprisingly dipped. Meanwhile a private business survey also disappointed., The data underscore fears of slowing economic growth in the world’s second-largest economy even as optimism about a potential trade deal between the Asian nation and the United States has been another leg of support for the market, as has recent robust U.S. economic data., In a performance akin to Friday’s, the market rose to new records Monday after strong economic data., Figures from the Commerce Department showed U.S. personal spending jumped 0.9% in March, ahead of a rise of 0.8% that had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus. But during the same period, core personal consumption expenditures, which are the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in below a Briefing.com consensus expectation for a 0.1% rise. (See more below.), The strong reading on consumer spending amid low inflation appeared to encourage investors about the state of the U.S. economy, especially after a surprisingly strong gross domestic product (GDP) figure last week., That sentiment appeared to cause some investors and traders to move out of the relative safety of U.S. government debt. Amid the selling, the yields, which move inversely to prices, on the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year Treasury bond rose., The rising yields helped the Financials sector rise more than 0.9%, making it the day’s biggest gainer. Banks tend to do better when longer-term yields are greater than shorter-term ones. That way they can earn more money on the interest they charge on loans than they have to pay out on deposits., On the flip side of the coin, the rising yields helped pressure Real Estate and Utilities. These two sectors are often considered bond proxies because of their history of stable payouts., When government bonds, which are considered safer than stocks, rise, that means more competition for these bond proxies, and investors can switch out of them and move into bonds. Also, for Real Estate, higher interest rates can crimp demand by making mortgages more expensive and properties less affordable., Monday offered a pretty classic Investment 101 scenario of investors and traders moving into stocks and out of bonds as they appeared to feel more bullish and perhaps wanted to not get left behind if momentum buying really stepped up., This FOMO (fear of missing out) trade helped send the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to record intraday and closing highs, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed higher., But the day’s gains weren’t all that impressive in percentage terms, ranging from a gain of 0.04% for the Dow to 0.19% for the Nasdaq. It seems that the buying momentum was kept in check by uncertainty surrounding a busy week ahead., In addition to continued earnings reports and the Fed meeting, U.S.-China trade negotiations that may be nearing a conclusion are continuing, and a widely-anticipated jobs report is scheduled for Friday morning., Figure 1: Lackluster: Gold futures dropped Monday. The decline came after the strong consumer spending data apparently dulled gold’s allure as a safe-haven investment. At the same time, a subdued inflation reading also likely pressured the metal, which is often considered a hedge against inflation. Data Source: CME Group.

Member SIPC., I am Chief Market Strategist for TD Ameritrade and began my career as a Chicago Board Options Exchange market maker, trading primarily in the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 50', 'Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) have been corporate fixtures for more than a decade, but there is still a bit of opacity about what ingredients CISOs add to the alphabet soup of C-level jobs., Generally, CISOs have a standard set of functions, ranging from creating security policies to managing their company’s security operations., Prior to 1994, the role didn’t even exist. Twenty-five years later, the position has gone from a good idea to a near necessity for enterprises with complex infrastructures and compliance standards. , Whenever I talk about my job, whether it’s at a speaking engagement or in a one-on-one conversation, eventually someone asks me what it’s like being a CISO for a cyber security company. The short answer is that it’s always interesting. The longer, more accurate response is that it requires the ability to see things from different perspectives. , Generally, CISOs have a standard set of functions, ranging from creating security policies to managing their company’s security operations. I also build and lead the execution of our compliance strategy as well as writing policy and working with IT and engineering teams. However, those are internal tasks. When your company is in the business of selling security products to other businesses, your job expands to include external responsibilities. , On a typical day (not that you have many of those), you may spend your morning working internal compliance strategies for your new products. As part of that process, you’re likely interacting with your sales team as if you’re a prospect or a customer. CISOs frequently get pitched by outside vendors, but hearing how your company’s team pitches your own products offers an interesting peek behind the curtain.  , After you’re done meeting with the sales team, you could be asked to provide a customer or prospect with proof that they can add your product to their digital environment without disrupting security or business. It’s interesting to hear how our large customers are applying new policy to their own network. I often take those ideas and build them into our internal policies and push them down to our vendors., Developing Mitigation Strategies, You could also get called on to find specific use cases to support sales. Advocating for your own product rather than reviewing an outside product is one pretty major difference between being a CISO at a security company and holding the same job somewhere else., The size of your organization also matters when it comes to day-to-day job responsibilities.  CISOs for larger security vendors may have a compliance staff who would handle that side of things. If that’s the case, you should get to know that group as well, because they will bring a different angle of understanding to the various things you’re meant to be protecting.  , CISOs at smaller companies or startups probably need to take a more hands-on approach. In my case, that includes leading a research team dedicated to understanding network threats and creating detection and mitigation strategies to help our customers. , Building a Security-Forward Culture, Being a CISO is both challenging and rewarding, no matter where you work. You will get to team up with incredibly talented and creative people. You can help create a culture in which people realize security is everyone’s responsibility. , Jeff Costlow is the CISO at ExtraHop. He started his career in computer security in 1997, and has deep experience with networking protocols, a passion for secure softwar...', 'Even amid pressure from increased competition in online advertising realm, Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) shares have been on a rip this year, up about 21.5% year to date as of April 24, versus a 17% rise in the S&amp;P 500 (SPX). The search engine giant is scheduled to release Q1 results after the closing bell April 29., As one of the FAANGs, which include Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), Google is a kind of bellwether for big players in the technology sector. For much of 2018, FAANGs’ momentum helped drive a solid rally for much of the year, and then played a large role in Q4’s steep losses. So far this year, FAANGs have had a lesser role in the more-broad-based rally, but their positive drive has certainly also contributed., GOOGL itself doesn’t provide quarterly guidance, but the Street expects it to report Q1 adjusted EPS of $10.56, down from $13.33 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $37.33 billion, up 19.9% from a year ago., Digital Advertising Revenue Hit Plateau in Q4, In Q4, GOOGL shares slid about 3% after it reported rising costs and a decline in advertising prices, where it gleans a good deal of revenue. Its core advertising revenue grew 20% to $32.6 billion, which was about the same rate of growth it saw in Q3, meaning that line of business had hit a bit of a plateau. Meanwhile, the costs for traffic acquisition, for example what it pays to other companies to be a default search engine, climbed 15% year over year to $7.44 billion., Still, GOOGL showed it continued to expand its hardware sales and cloud business, and earnings and revenue topped Street estimates. Q4 revenue was $39.3 billion, up 22% from the year prior, and earnings were $12.77 per share, up 12% year over year., Its “other revenue,” which includes Google Play, hardware and cloud computing, increased 31% year over year to $6.49 billion, although the company did not break down that number to show exactly where the growth came from. CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call that Google Cloud was one of the company’s “fastest-growing business segments.” He also said the company “more than doubled” the number of Cloud Platform deals over $1 million and the number of multi-year contracts, although he didn’t provide specifics., “Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge and one that is constantly getting harder,” Pichai said., In events since its last quarterly report, GOOGL was hit with a roughly $1.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission over what the commission said was abuse of its dominant position in the market. GOOGL is accounting for the entire fine in the first quarter, so that will reduce its earnings and operating income, as well as its net income. That’s the third massive fine for GOOGL from the EU in about three years, totaling about $9.4 billion, so investors are likely hoping its regulatory headaches are over soon., GOOGL Options Activity, The options market has priced in about a 3.6% stock move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, For the May 3 options expiration, volume has been light overall. Put options have been most active at the 1230 strike. On the call side, the 1300 strike has been the most active, followed by the 1310 strike. Implied volatility was at the42nd percentile as of Friday morning., Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time., FOLLOW THE FAANGS.

Although Sidewalk Labs announced its ambitions to bid for Toronto\\'s redevelopment in 2017, this is the first document that fully lays out its ultimate vision, which includes proposals for two neighborhoods—Quayside and Villiers West—as well as a larger Innovative Development and Economic Acceleration (IDEA) district., Dan Doctoroff, the CEO of the Alphabet subsidiary and a former deputy mayor of New York City, touted the plan as a “groundbreaking blueprint for the neighborhood of the future” that is environmentally friendly and built for people of all income levels. Residential units make up 67% of the planned development in the main Quayside district, for example, with 40% at below-market prices, and Sidewalk promises 1,700 affordable housing units in all. , “We think it’s the first true articulation of what’s really possible when you combine cutting-edge innovation and forward-looking urban design to produce an inclusive community,” Doctoroff said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. , Sidewalk has stipulated the creation of an independent Civic Data Trust to handle digital governance issues and has also committed not to sell personal information, not to use personal information for advertising and not to disclose information to third parties without explicit consent., Waterfront Toronto said in a statement that based on a read-through of the plans, it will require additional information to establish whether the initial proposals are in compliance with applicable laws and its own data principles. , Doctoroff said that Sidewalk would continue to work closely with the government and community groups to move its plan forward and described the process as “like a 50-sided Rubik\\'s cube.” , The master plan outlines a capital-intensive investment for Sidewalk, though also one that could potentially be incredibly lucrative. At this point, Alphabet’s subsidiary companies like Sidewalk, called its “Other Bets,” have generated very little revenue. In the company’s most recent quarterly earnings, the “Other Bets” reported losses of $868 million and $170 million in revenue. , For much more detail, check out the planning documents below: , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly. Previously', \"Google cofounder and CEO Larry Page, Uber's S-1 filing reveals other financial ties as well: It paid Alphabet hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising, infrastructure and mapping services over the last several years.  , “We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate,” the company writes. , Uber also shelled out for marketing and enterprise services. , Over two years, Uber paid Alphabet $631 million for marketing and advertising, $70 million for infrastructure and enterprise services and $1 million for “related services.”, Google paid Uber for a bit of promotion too:, The company spent $3.1 million since January 2017 for the ride-hailing service to promote Google Pay, its mobile wallet, within its app. , Overall, the two companies have a complicated relationship. , Along with Alphabet’s financial windfall, the S-1 appeared to give Waymo additional legal victories. A California arbitration panel reviewing Waymo’s claim against Anthony Levandowski, the former Google and Uber engineer who sparked their high-profile 2017 fight over trade secrets, determined on March 26 that he is on the hook for a $127 million award to Waymo. Uber, which acquired Levandowski’s company and brought him in to oversee its self-driving car project, said it’s contesting whether it’s obligated to pay some or all of that potential settlement, which may also include court and legal fees. , Additionally, an independent software investigator brought in to assess whether Uber’s driverless car system used any technology originating from Waymo found “certain functions in our autonomous vehicle software that are problematic and other functions that are not,” Uber said. , “If these interim findings become final, they could result in a license fee or in design changes that could require substantial time and resources to implement, and could limit or delay our production of autonomous vehicle technologies,” Uber said in the filing. , The review continues, and Waymo said in an emailed statement that it “will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our confidential information is not being used by Uber.”, Alphabet shows up a handful of times in the risks section of Uber’s filing. In addition to the mapping example, Uber also cites its reliance on Google’s app store, Play, and Apple’s App Store, as a risk, writing that it can’t guarantee that the two companies won’t start charging fees to download its app. Waymo is name-dropped as a competitor, too, along with a host of other companies working on self-driving capabilities. , I’m a San Francisco-based staff writer for Forbes reporting on Google and the rest of the Alphabet universe, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly. Previously\", 'Waymo CEO John Krafcik has put together a range of alliances with companies ranging from Fiat Chrysler, Jaguar Land Rover, Lyft, Avis and AutoNation. The partnership with Renault and Nissan may be Waymo\\'s biggest to date.    , Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving vehicle unit, is preparing to expand the scope of its autonomous tech efforts beyond the U.S. in a new partnership with the Renault-Nissan Alliance aimed at creating driverless mobility services for France and Japan.   , The companies entered into an “exclusive” arrangement for an unspecified period to research commercial, legal and regulatory issues for revenue-generating mobility businesses, including autonomous ride services and goods delivery. A joint statement didn’t mention whether specific Renault or Nissan vehicles would be involved but  said the effort is a first step to figuring out “long-term, profitable driverless mobility services operations,” adding that it may expand to other countries. , Waymo, \"This is an ideal opportunity for Waymo to bring our autonomous technology to a global stage, with an innovative partner,” Waymo CEO John Krafcik said. “With the Alliance’s international reach and scale, our Waymo Driver can deliver transformational mobility solutions to safely serve riders and commercial deliveries in France, Japan, and other countries.\", “Regulation is one of the gating factors—we continue to work with quite a number of places that are excited about the opportunity to have self-driving cars because of the opportunity to help save lives,” Porat said. “We see opportunities globally for that.”, Waymo self-driving vehicles on display at the Google I/O 2018 Conference at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.   , “We believe this partnership will accelerate our commitment to deliver new shared mobility services and benefit the automobile ecosystems by placing us at the forefront of driverless mobility new business streams in our key strategic markets,” said Renault Group CEO Thierry Bolloré. , The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance is a powerhouse with combined global sales of more than 10 million autos annually, a model lineup spanning all passenger and light commercial vehicle segments, including a range of battery electric vehicles. Waymo is the de facto leader in self-driving technology, with a program stretching back a decade and more autonomous test and simulation miles than any competitor. , For its part, Nissan plans to be an early player in the driverless mobility space, CEO and President Hiroto Saikawa said. , “Our expertise in the global automotive industry and expertise in strategic partnership will enable us to explore opportunities to grow our portfolio and deliver new value to customers with Waymo, the recognized leader in this space,” he said. , With reporting assistance from Jillian D’Onfro in San Francisco., From Los Angeles, the U.S. capital of cars and congestion, I try to make sense of technology-driven changes reshaping transportation, cities and how we get around.
