      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">Facebook announced a brand policy change. Instagram and WhatsApp will now be endorsed by the Facebook corporate brand. Previously, these two popular social media brands were left as stand-alone brands within the Facebook portfolio. The Facebook move is designed for consolidation and revenue-generating reasons. Over the years, Facebook has moved to bring Instagram and WhatsApp closer into the Facebook model with more opportunities for cross-selling ads. Under the rubric of letting people know what products and services Facebook offers, Mr. Zuckerberg chose “From Facebook” as the designation.</p>, <p>Brand endorsement policies can create internal dissension. It is not uncommon for the management teams of acquired brands or new brands to not want to be associated with their parent brand. Lou Gerstner faced this problem when he became CEO of IBM in the 1990s. The ThinkPad team did not want the IBM logo on its laptops. Mr. Gerstner made it clear that ThinkPad was an IBM ThinkPad.</p>, <p>According to those in the know, Facebook’s brand policy change appears to be dictated by Mark Zuckerberg. Recent reporting indicates that there are managers who think that this endorsement strategy is a mistake. These managers state that positive user perceptions of Instagram’s and WhatsApp’s images are in peril. Internal data indicate that when Instagram and WhatsApp users are told the brands are Facebook-owned, positive perceptions of Instagram and WhatsApp fall.</p>, <p>Mr. Zuckerberg’s move is seen frequently in businesses with branded portfolios. Today, we see some firms moving from having a portfolio of individual brands, where each individual brand builds preference on its own, to a corporate branded portfolio, where individual brands share a common, provenance-based corporate-derived heritage. Yet, this is not without internal challenges. For example, Holiday Inn hotels are marketed as part of a broad portfolio of hotel brands from IHG: “Holiday Inn, an IHG hotel,” Crowne Plaza, an IHG hotel,” “Hotel Indigo, an IHG hotel,” and so on. However, Kimpton and Regent Hotels and Resorts, recent IHG acquisitions, resist being identified as part of the IHG portfolio.</p>, <p>If any brand needs a jolt of respectability, it is Facebook. The problem lurking within the Facebook strategy change is that Facebook’s trustworthiness has been severely damaged and Mr. Zuckerberg has not moved to right the listing ship. It must be frustrating to know that Instagram and WhatsApp have more positive, trustworthy images than their Facebook parent brand. The bigger issue is whether Zuckerberg feels that Facebook association with Instagram and WhatsApp will provide a positive image to their parent brand, Facebook. This is not likely.</p>, <p>Mr. Zuckerberg may be testing the limits of his power to have a massive parent brand with strong tentacles across a portfolio of brands by bringing Instagram and WhatsApp under the Facebook corporate banner. If Zuckerberg considers the endorsement strategy to be a pathway to rebuilding Facebook trust, counting on Instagram and WhatsApp to help repair Facebook’s disgraced image, this is a brand-business pipedream.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"My focus is building brands as the basis for enduring profitable business growth.

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Marcus, CEO of Facebook's Calibra digital wallet service, speaks during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, July 17, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p>, <p>Looked at through the prism of a question asked by Foroohar, and that she plainly didn’t understand, “easier cross-border financial flows” have been the sole purpose of capitalist production for as long as the world’s inhabitants have been able to specialize, and in the process exchange the fruits of their own labor for the fruits of others. For one to work is for one to express a powerful desire to import. The importing could be from across the street or from the other side of the world, but import it is. The “cross-border financial flows” that Foroohar so naively disdains are merely happy evidence of a world that grows more connected by the day.</p>, <p>With its proposed introduction of the Libra, Facebook is thankfully aiming to enhance the ability of individuals to exchange with other individuals. Will it succeed? Who knows? Foroohar thinks not, so she dismisses the very notion of the Libra with misplaced and misinformed contempt. She misses the point. To see why, please read on.</p>, <p>\"Technology is a boom or bust business, but it’s mostly busts. I’ve always assumed 10% of my technology investments will succeed – and succeed wildly. The other 90% I expect to fail.” Those are the words of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.</p>, <p>As Foroohar sees it, the Libra “threatens to take us in the wrong direction, at exactly the wrong time.” Ok, but if it does then it will surely vanish as a measure of value for it taking us in the wrong direction. Foroohar is against the Libra given her expressed view that it will fail, but then every innovation the world has ever known (from the tractor to the airplane to the Apple iPhone) was met with the nose-turned-up superciliousness of the kind that Foroohar is directing at the Libra. Missed by Foroohar is that innovation is all about failure. Maybe the Libra won’t work, but even if so, currencies and commerce will be more attractively situated for better future effectiveness thanks to Facebook’s efforts to meet the needs of people now.</p>, <p>That the people who make up any economy don’t trust government money is hardly a new, libertarian-ish thing. Going back many, many centuries to China’s Song dynasty, the Confucians at the time supported private money over what government would issue because \"the market would compel private issuers of money to maintain its value.\" Remember, no one ever trades money. Though “money” is exchanged with blinding regularity, the latter is an expression of a desire to move actual goods and services. The problem has long been that floating, unstable money forms issued by governments have corrupted what is always and everywhere about products for products. It’s created winners and losers despite trade logically being about each side of a transaction having been improved after the fact.</p>, <p>Floating money values have been the cause of trade not enhancing one or both parties, and the reason is basic: so long as money fluctuates in terms of value, those who take money in return for tangible goods and services will sometimes get less than they brought to market in return.  Libra is a market response to money that no longer lives up to its singular purpose as a measure that facilitates the exchange of products for other products of roughly equal value.</p>, <p>The good news is that in her response to what will improve the trade that is the basis of all economic activity, Foroohar didn’t lay a glove on Facebook. If we ignore her embarrassing dismissal of “cross-border financial flows,” Foroohar was reduced to worrying that crime would increase if governments were replaced by private issuers of money. Please. Let’s try to be serious. Those in the large – and growing - gambling and drug spaces could and would easily dismiss what some PR person relayed to Foroohar.</p>, <p>Back to reality, a stable Libra represents opportunity for billions of workers around the world who’ve periodically suffered the capricious ways of monetary authorities on the way to the evisceration of their work. Basically Facebook can’t err in the way that governments have, and still remain in business. Thank goodness for the Libra. Foroohar might agree had she not grown up in the U.S., and as such, had she not always been able to earn dollars that, despite their own periodic instability, have always been exchangeable for goods and services around the world.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"I'm a speech and op-ed writer, Director of the Center for Economic Freedom at FreedomWorks, editor of RealClearMarkets, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Researc...\">I'm a speech and op-ed writer, Director of the Center for Economic Freedom at FreedomWorks, editor of RealClearMarkets, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Researc...</p>]\n"

      "[<p class=\"speakable-paragraph\">For decades, computer programmers have been trying to beat multiplayer games by finding reliable patterns in data.</p>, <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smart bearded person in a classic gray suit is playing poker at casino in smoke sitting at the table with chips and cards on it . He is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand and looking away. Gambling addiction. Sincere emotions and entertainment concept.</p>, <p>This is a big step forward for data science. It shows where the world is headed.</p>, <p>Collecting and understanding data is key.</p>, <p>There have been big strides in programs mastering board games like checkers and chess. A super AI called AlphaGo, a prototype from Google Mind, even conquered Go, an extremely complex Chinese strategy game. It trounced Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world, in a widely publicized match.</p>, <p>Many software developers assumed Go was unassailable given the state of AI development.</p>, <p>But AlphaGo caught Sedol off-guard. Developed by playing against itself millions of times, the software learned to be unpredictable. In the end, Sedol couldn’t determine why moves were being made.</p>, <p>Pluribus, the Facebook and CMU collaboration, leans hard on being unpredictable. It makes sense.</p>, <p>Whereas checkers, chess and even Go are limited to two players, poker traditionally involves more, creating a significant challenge for an AI. Exploiting the weaknesses of a single player would not be enough. Pluribus was designed to take on five world-class opponents simultaneously.</p>, <p>With six players, six hands of cards, the bets, and the sheer multitude of possible outcomes, the game would have overwhelmed even the most robust supercomputer. Pluribus needed a reliable edge.</p>, <p>The edge researchers used was counterfactual regret minimization.</p>, <p>The big idea: During training, as Pluribus played against itself, the AI noted the outcome of games given all of the variables. Then, the software systematically played game after game, altering a variable each time.</p>, <p>Pluribus learned that some moves, even crazy ones, were winners in defined circumstances. Flummoxed players, for example, would fold. And that is the key.</p>, <p>We humans fidget nervously; we behave predictably when we are anxious. Professional poker players can spot these tells a mile away. Pluribus does not really play to its opponents’ weaknesses. It plays to its inherent strength — it has no tell. It is completely unpredictable.</p>, <p>The proof is in the gameplay.</p>, <p>Researchers set Pluribus up against world-class professional poker players, including Jimmy Chou, Seth Daniels, Michael Gagliano, Sean Ruane and Jacob Toole. In 10,000 hands of Texas Hold ‘Em with five other players, Pluribus won chips consistently, along with high praise from its human competitors.</p>, <p>Ruane even marveled at its relentless consistency.</p>, <p>Public cloud infrastructure is democratizing computer processing and data storage. And Software-as-a-Service companies are building bolt-on applications to turn mountains of corporate data into actionable insights.</p>, <p>It was a bold pitch, but Stoecker was on to something bigger — digital transformation.</p>, <p>Sales in the first quarter, which ended March 31, were $76 million, a 51% increase year over year. Gross profits were $68 million, and cash flow was $16 million. The company logged 2018 sales of $253 million, up 92.6% vs.  2017.</p>, <p>The business is growing fast and that is being reflected in the share price. Alteryx shares are up 104% this year, and 209% during the past 12 months.</p>, <p>Shares trade at 166x forward earnings and 26x sales. This stock is not cheap, but it’s the right stock for this era of new business models built with data.</p>, <p>Growth investors should consider buying Alteryx into bouts of weakness.</p>, <p>I am an  investment adviser, trader, columnist and author based in Seattle.

      "[<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: Getty</p>, <p class=\"speakable-paragraph\"><span>The Achilles’ heel of crypto is security. This is ironic because the whole thing about crypto is security and the safety it brings to things, especially information.</span></p>, <p><span>However, crypto has been beset on all sides by scammers. Whether it is disappearing exchanges, scam initial coin offerings, robbers, hackers, fake investment schemes or goings on in the dark web, crypto has a massive crime problem.</span></p>, <p><span>Where there are resources there are predators, so this should not be a surprise.</span></p>, <p><span>Facebook’s Libra project recently being dragged to congress for hearings to explain itself is causing a stir even while it now seems that it will be some time before it goes live. A global private sector currency with a vast captive audience has made quite a few government money folks’ eyes bug out. Libra is a monetary ‘Mars attack.’ It is also an inevitable one, bound to be followed by many large organizations in search of printing their own money.</span></p>, <p><span>The flip side of the criminal onslaught is the huge interest that bitcoin and other cryptos garner in the general populations. You can’t be interviewed as a public figure without someone popping a bitcoin question at you. It’s as if every financial and political figure was asked about the future and stock price of Netflix, a company with a similar market cap to bitcoin. This interest is not going away and will be a driver for the whole industry in the same way that bottom up interest in being online drove the take up of the internet and WWW.</span></p>, <p><span>So it is not surprising that this week finds the first flush of libra crypto scammers moving in to steal money from the unwary.</span></p>, <p><span>At least one criminal outfit has advertised access to libra on Facebook this week inviting \"expressions of interest in libra.\" Anyone who registered for that would then get hit up by a boiler room.</span></p>, <p><span>The curious user reported the following:</span></p>, <p><span>“Today I get a call from a boiler room saying they are Facebook in Switzerland and wanting me to set up an account so I can trade. Apparently, I don’t need to worry if I have not done it before; a broker could do it for me. They were going to give $300 to start with to trade implying this was $300 of libra.”</span></p>, <p><span>This is all reminiscent of the criminals who worked in \"binary bets\" a simple bilk where if the vicious gambling product didn’t get you, then the company would by simply not paying your money back, which was vastly more likely to be what you had left after losses than winnings. This was a very lucrative racket for some very shady people creating such a pestilence that the EU and many other jurisdictions shut down the basis of the swindle, the trading of binary bets. </span></p>, <p><span>If you see anything like this in future, simply ignore it. The Libra scams have begun and there will be a world more of them coming our way.</span></p>, <p><span>The question I really want answered is, how on earth did this outfit get to advertise on Facebook? Having been pummeled for a $5 billion fine for not keeping its users safe, here is a blatant example of Facebook putting its users at risk, by enabling a shady, unregulated and likely criminal organization to prey on its users.</span></p>, <p><span>It’s unlikely that this crypto ad showed up on this user’s Facebook without there being a filter for him being a trader, crypto enthusiast or investor. Even if Facebook didn’t specifically target him for this outfit, how could it even get onto the platform at all?</span></p>, <p><span>If Facebook is going to launch Libra, it needs to care about these things and start locking out the obvious predators from its estate. How hard can it be to spot a financial bucket shop trying to sell your own unreleased crypto currency?</span></p>, <p><span>Really hard if you don’t give a wooden nickel.</span></p>, <p><a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\"><em data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek\">Forbes Special Offer: Be among the first to get important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential.

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who heads the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote that his panel is \"investigating racist, sexist and xenophobic comments relating to immigrants and members of Congress made by employees of the Customs and Border Protection in 'secret' Facebook groups.\"</p>, <p>\"The committee is concerned that Border Patrol agents and other CBP employees who wrote posts disparaging immigrants may still be working with immigrants and children,\" Cummings wrote.</p>, <p>In testimony to the committee earlier this month, acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan described the posts as \"unacceptable,\" and said that CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility had launched an investigation.</p>, <p>McAleenan told the committee that the agency had placed several employees on administrative duty, but could not name any of the specific positions who had been reassigned owing to the investigation.</p>, <p>Cummings is suspicious. In his letter, he asks for information in a number of areas about the groups and the internal investigation, and notes that the CBP did not honor his request for a briefing on the matter.</p>, <p>Spokesmen for the CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>, <p>In a statement, a Facebook spokesman said the company has \"been in regular contact with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee and will continue to work with the committee to lawfully obtain the information it is seeking.\"</p>, <p>\"We are also continuing to cooperate with federal authorities,\" the spokesman added.</p>, <p>ProPublica noted that the CBP posts, made in secret Facebook groups known as \"I'm 10-15\" and \"The Real CBP Nation\" come as \"the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces.\"</p>, <p>Cummings has issued an expansive data request to CBP, calling for the agency to turn over every piece of content from the secret Facebook groups dating to Jan. 20, 2017, along with identifying information about the thousands of current and former CBP employees who were members of the groups.</p>, <p>He is also seeking the name, position and employment status of every employee who is under investigation.</p>, <p>Cummings further asks the CBP to comply with his request for a briefing on the matter by Aug. 7, 2019.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...\">Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...</p>]\n",

This problem of human latency is a key hurdle for tech giants like Google and Facebook that are looking for new ways to grow by shoving ever-more petabytes of data into our brains, and vice versa. </p>, <p>As part of their effort, Facebook has been funding a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) working to help patients with neurological damage to speak again by detecting imagined speech in real time. </p>, <p> Facebook hopes the work of the UCSF team will serve as a proof of concept to inform the development of the non-invasive wearable it dreams of pairing with AR glasses.</p>, <p> \"If we can now measure signals in the brain via implantable devices, then we can transmit those signals outside of the brain.\"</p>, <p>Facebook thinks that a promising way to make the leap from \"reading minds\" via wired electrodes to a wireless system is by measuring changes in oxygen levels in the brain using infrared light similar to a pulse oximeter at a doctor's office. </p>, <p>\"This could work, though I am afraid that the rates (timing) of oxygenation processes are much lower than the actual rate at which speech is produced,\" Josep Jornet, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, told me. \"Certainly more work is needed, but this is what research is about and should be promoted.\"</p>, <p>Todd Richmond, an IEEE member and Director of the Tech and Narrative Lab at the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica says \"having a viable capability in the lab\" to wirelessly send brain signals to a computer could be less than five years away.</p>, <p> \"It will likely take longer to move from the lab to commercial deployment for a variety of reasons,\" he adds.</p>, <p>Richmond thinks the first hurdles will be solving technical problems to make the system lighter, smaller, faster and essentially, more practical.

The post has been updated to reflect its position.</em></strong></p>, <p>The encryption debate is typically framed around the concept of an impenetrable link connecting two services whose communications the government wishes to monitor. The reality, of course, is that the security of that encryption link is entirely separate from the security of the devices it connects. The ability of encryption to shield a user’s communications rests upon the assumption that the sender and recipient’s devices are themselves secure, with the encrypted channel the only weak point.</p>, <p>After all, if either user’s device is compromised, unbreakable encryption is of little relevance.</p>, <p>This is why surveillance operations typically focus on compromising end devices, bypassing the encryption debate entirely. If a user’s cleartext keystrokes and screen captures can be streamed off their device in real-time, it matters little that they are eventually encrypted for transmission elsewhere.</p>, <p>Historically, compromising end devices was an expensive and complex process, powered by a cat-and-mouse game with hardware manufacturers and software vendors to find vulnerabilities that could be used to remotely install them and acquire the necessary device privileges.</p>, <p>Such efforts are hard to scale and the more devices that are compromised, the more likely the vulnerability is to be discovered and patched.</p>, <p>In Facebook’s vision, the actual end-to-end encryption client itself such as WhatsApp will include embedded content moderation and blacklist filtering algorithms. These algorithms will be continually updated from a central cloud service, but will run locally on the user’s device, scanning each cleartext message before it is sent and each encrypted message after it is decrypted.</p>, <p>Facebook’s model entirely bypasses the encryption debate by globalizing the current practice of compromising devices by building those encryption bypasses directly into the communications clients themselves and deploying what amounts to machine-based wiretaps to billions of users at once.</p>, <p>Asked the current status of this work and when it might be deployed in the production version of WhatsApp, a company spokesperson declined to comment.</p>, <p>Of course, Facebook’s efforts apply only to its own encryption clients, leaving criminals and terrorists to turn to other clients like Signal or their own bespoke clients they control the source code of.</p>, <p><strong>[UPDATE: 6:30PM EST 8/2/2019]: Facebook disagrees that the F8 video on using artificial intelligence to keep content safe indicates it is planning to surveil users’ information. In Facebook’s words, \"We haven't added a backdoor to WhatsApp,\" said WhatsApp vice president Will Cathcart in a post on HackerNews. \"To be crystal clear, we have not done this, have zero plans to do so, and if we ever did it would be quite obvious and detectable that we had done it. We understand the serious concerns this type of approach would raise which is why we are opposed to it,\" Cathcart wrote.</strong></p>, <p>The problem is that if Facebook’s model succeeds, it will only be a matter of time before device manufacturers and mobile operating system developers embed similar tools directly into devices themselves, making them impossible to escape. Embedding content scanning tools directly into phones would make it possible to scan all apps, including ones like Signal, effectively ending the era of encrypted communications.</p>, <p>Governments would soon use lawful court orders to require companies to build in custom filters of content they are concerned about and automatically notify them of violations, including sending a copy of the offending content.</p>, <p>Rather than grappling with how to defeat encryption, governments will simply be able to harness social media companies to perform their mass surveillance for them, sending them real-time alerts and copies of the decrypted content.</p>, <p>While some phone manufacturers could distinguish themselves by offering bespoke phones with custom operating systems that do not include such scanning, such devices are likely to be rare, used only by those who are willing to go to great lengths to escape government scrutiny and thus automatically drawing substantial attention to themselves. Over time, it is likely that many governments will simply pass laws banning the possession and use of such devices, much as many jurisdictions ban devices that help speeders escape traffic tickets.</p>, <p>In the end, encryption’s days are numbered and the world has Facebook to thank.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...\">Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...</p>]\n"

The issue ahead of Facebook becomes less if people will ever trust Facebook again, that ship has sailed unless they find a new business model.

After all, financial theory argues that all relevant information about stocks is instantly priced in. Therefore, as the late John Bogle argued so well, you're better off matching the market by buying a low-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund.</p>, <p>This comes to mind in considering the latest earnings reports from Tesla and Facebook. How so? Tesla's CEO Elon Musk excites all sorts of volatile emotions among his followers — love for the company's products and his heroic exploits and fear as every quarterly report induces agony about whether the company will make money or meet its production targets.</p>, <p>By contrast, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg does not produce such emotional volatility. Lacking Musk's charisma, he regularly outrages people when violating norms about selling peoples' Facebook activity to corporate and political interests. People keep getting their dopamine hits from the endless stream of likes on their Facebook posts and despite fines and threat of government interference, the company keeps on beating expectations when it reports quarterly results.</p>, <p>If you must buy an individual stock — buy one that passes the System 2 test rather than the one that excites your System 1. For example, buy Facebook and dump Tesla. (I have no financial interest in the securities mentioned in this post).</p>, <p>Meanwhile Tesla failed miserably when it comes to System 2 — losing money, burning through more cash and doing so in a way that fell short of investors' expectations. Tesla shares are down 15% in 2019 and have risen at a more impressive 32% average annual rate since their July 2010 IPO.</p>, <p>Facebook proved that government fines — such as the $5 billion FTC fine it's paying to settle the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal — and investigations are a minor cost of sustaining its expectations-beating, profitable growth. As it transitions from a business model based on advertising to News Feed to one based on advertising to Stories (of which it has 500 million users), Messenger and WhatsApp, it grew its top line and earnings more rapidly than expected. </p>, <p>But it has a long road ahead to meet its production targets for 2019. Tesla still expects to sell between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019 — mostly Model 3s — of which it delivered around 158,200 in the first half of 2019. It has to deliver \"more than 200,000 in the back half of the year to hit the low-end of its guidance,\" according to CNBC. </p>, <p>If you must buy individual stocks, Facebook is clearly the better bet — but if you like a good story, Musk's emotional ups and downs beat Zuckerberg's steady dopamine drip hands down.  </p>, <p><a class=\"color-link\" href=\"https:// http://bit.ly/32Nrsqq\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forbes Special Report: Picking the right investment opportunities is critical.

In the aftermath of the 2016 election, news relating to the new administration and its policies were a common refrain in the call for more safe spaces. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s social media platforms saturate those same vulnerable individuals with ceaseless political ads that are impossible to escape. Why don’t platforms like Facebook allow users to opt-out of political advertisements, creating digital safe spaces from content that triggers them?</p>, <p>In our ever more hyper-partisan world in which differing viewpoints and information that conflicts with one’s viewpoints and beliefs or which touches upon past traumatic experiences can lead to intense psychological trauma, so-called “safe spaces” have emerged in the academic and corporate world as a way to escape the traumas of the real world.</p>, <p>Despite their growing popularity, these physical rooms have no counterpart in the digital world.</p>, <p>Attempting to insulate oneself online from contrary viewpoints or information or from narratives that touch upon past traumatic experiences is next to impossible. By their very design social media platforms are constructed to flood their users with an endless stream of information that is algorithmically curated just for them, personalized to maximize their reaction. Given that outrage provokes a far more energetic (and thus monetizable) response than serenity, the more social media platforms learn about us, the more they surround us with an endless curated firehose of hate and horror that is personalized just for us.</p>, <p>Broadcast platforms like Twitter make it difficult to escape such content, since anyone can reach anyone else, yet even closed social networks like Facebook, in which connections are reciprocal, pose a growing challenge through their advertising.</p>, <p>On Facebook a user can carefully construct their social group to ensure it consists only of those who think and act exactly like themselves, creating a homogeneous echo chamber that entirely insulates them from the outside world.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, this echo chamber cannot protect them from advertisements.</p>, <p>Notably absent from this list are political advertisements. Political and issue advertisements frequently touch upon the rawest and most divisive societal fracture lines that are often what drive individuals to seek refuge within those physical safe spaces. An ad for a brand of soda or bath towels at the local supermarket are unlikely to trigger trauma in the average person. Political ads, by their very nature, are designed to prompt strong emotional responses along the fault lines that define the partisan world of politics.</p>, <p>Getting away from these ads can be nearly impossible. Today’s ads are so hyper-targeted and run in such vast quantities that no amount of clicking “don’t show me this ad” can stop the deluge, especially around election time.</p>, <p>A user who is triggered by any mention of a particular political candidate who is running for election in their district will find it effectively impossible to escape their barrage of campaign ads on Facebook.

They are simply impossible to escape in today’s digital-first campaigning.</p>, <p>For a company like Facebook that has embraced the concept of safe spaces in the physical world, why does it not offer the digital equivalent on its platform, allowing its users to get away from political advertisements that cause them enormous emotional distress?</p>, <p>A company spokesperson confirmed the company’s commitment to safe spaces and noted that it offers meditation spaces and special rooms for its own employees as a form of “safe space” and that for employees that feel triggered at work, many are permitted to work from home to escape those triggers. The spokesperson also noted that the company has rolled out new policies this year governing its internal message boards and communications forums in an effort to make all employees comfortable.</p>, <p>Yet when asked why the company does not extend the same courtesy to offer the digital equivalent of such safe spaces to its two billion users to escape from advertisements that cause them deep distress or trauma and may even trigger hospitalization, the spokesperson said the company did not have comment.</p>, <p>Asked why the company does not at the very least allow users to request that political ads be displayed with a blurred overlay with a trigger warning that requires manually clicking to see the actual ad, the company again declined to comment.</p>, <p>This raises the question of why the company apparently does not believe that “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings” are a useful or important tool in today’s world for its users, despite extending such protections to its own employees. After all, if Facebook believed safe spaces were so important, it would roll them out on its own site by allowing users to protect themselves from triggering advertising content. Once again, the company declined to comment.</p>, <p>Asked whether the company believes it should be held legally, ethically or morally responsible if a user suffers emotional distress or hospitalization from encountering an advertisement that triggers them given that the company actively refuses to allow users to remove political advertisements from their Facebook experience, the company again declined to comment.</p>, <p>Given that Facebook does actively screen advertisements to ensure that they comply with its terms of service, it is not a neutral platform. It has a set of content standards and actively enforces these through moderation. This raises the question of how it would respond to the criticism that if it is actively enforcing content standards on its platform, it has a moral responsibility to provide a safe space on its platform that protects users from allowable content that triggers them. Again, the company declined to comment.</p>, <p>Of course, one could argue that the point of advertising is to allow users to be forcibly exposed to views and perspectives they might not otherwise consume. At the same time, there must be a balance between forcible exposure to unexpected content and forced exposure to unwanted content that causes immense distress.</p>, <p>On possibility would be to allow users to select the specific issues, political parties and candidates they would like to hear from, isolating them from issues and candidates that trigger them. Asked whether the company would consider offering such options, the company again declined to comment.</p>, <p>Putting this all together, despite endorsing the concept of safe spaces and providing them to its own employees, Facebook appears to have little interest in offering a digital equivalent to its two billion users that would allow them to shield themselves from the increasingly divisive political and issue ads that can cause them immense trauma and distress.</p>, <p>The company’s refusal to comment on any of these issues reminds us that for all its public statements, it has little interest in meaningful change that would impact its bottom line.</p>, <p>In the end, as long as political ads bring in revenue, it will be impossible to escape them.</p>, <p _ngcontent-c26=\"\" class=\"author-description\" innerhtml=\"Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...\">Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...</p>]\n"

      "['[(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle), Facebook announced a brand policy change. Instagram and WhatsApp will now be endorsed by the Facebook corporate brand. Previously, these two popular social media brands were left as stand-alone brands within the Facebook portfolio. The Facebook move is designed for consolidation and revenue-generating reasons. Over the years, Facebook has moved to bring Instagram and WhatsApp closer into the Facebook model with more opportunities for cross-selling ads. Under the rubric of letting people know what products and services Facebook offers, Mr. Zuckerberg chose “From Facebook” as the designation., Brand endorsement policies can create internal dissension. It is not uncommon for the management teams of acquired brands or new brands to not want to be associated with their parent brand. Lou Gerstner faced this problem when he became CEO of IBM in the 1990s. The ThinkPad team did not want the IBM logo on its laptops. Mr. Gerstner made it clear that ThinkPad was an IBM ThinkPad., According to those in the know, Facebook’s brand policy change appears to be dictated by Mark Zuckerberg. Recent reporting indicates that there are managers who think that this endorsement strategy is a mistake. These managers state that positive user perceptions of Instagram’s and WhatsApp’s images are in peril. Internal data indicate that when Instagram and WhatsApp users are told the brands are Facebook-owned, positive perceptions of Instagram and WhatsApp fall., Mr. Zuckerberg’s move is seen frequently in businesses with branded portfolios. Today, we see some firms moving from having a portfolio of individual brands, where each individual brand builds preference on its own, to a corporate branded portfolio, where individual brands share a common, provenance-based corporate-derived heritage. Yet, this is not without internal challenges. For example, Holiday Inn hotels are marketed as part of a broad portfolio of hotel brands from IHG: “Holiday Inn, an IHG hotel,” Crowne Plaza, an IHG hotel,” “Hotel Indigo, an IHG hotel,” and so on. However, Kimpton and Regent Hotels and Resorts, recent IHG acquisitions, resist being identified as part of the IHG portfolio., If any brand needs a jolt of respectability, it is Facebook. The problem lurking within the Facebook strategy change is that Facebook’s trustworthiness has been severely damaged and Mr. Zuckerberg has not moved to right the listing ship. It must be frustrating to know that Instagram and WhatsApp have more positive, trustworthy images than their Facebook parent brand. The bigger issue is whether Zuckerberg feels that Facebook association with Instagram and WhatsApp will provide a positive image to their parent brand, Facebook. This is not likely., Mr. Zuckerberg may be testing the limits of his power to have a massive parent brand with strong tentacles across a portfolio of brands by bringing Instagram and WhatsApp under the Facebook corporate banner. If Zuckerberg considers the endorsement strategy to be a pathway to rebuilding Facebook trust, counting on Instagram and WhatsApp to help repair Facebook’s disgraced image, this is a brand-business pipedream., My focus is building brands as the basis for enduring profitable business growth. I have won a variety of marketing awards. In its report on Best Marketers of the Decade...]', '[David Marcus, CEO of Facebook\\'s Calibra digital wallet service, speaks during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Facebook\\'s proposed cryptocurrency on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, July 17, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik), Looked at through the prism of a question asked by Foroohar, and that she plainly didn’t understand, “easier cross-border financial flows” have been the sole purpose of capitalist production for as long as the world’s inhabitants have been able to specialize, and in the process exchange the fruits of their own labor for the fruits of others. For one to work is for one to express a powerful desire to import. The importing could be from across the street or from the other side of the world, but import it is. The “cross-border financial flows” that Foroohar so naively disdains are merely happy evidence of a world that grows more connected by the day., With its proposed introduction of the Libra, Facebook is thankfully aiming to enhance the ability of individuals to exchange with other individuals. Will it succeed? Who knows? Foroohar thinks not, so she dismisses the very notion of the Libra with misplaced and misinformed contempt. She misses the point. To see why, please read on., \"Technology is a boom or bust business, but it’s mostly busts. I’ve always assumed 10% of my technology investments will succeed – and succeed wildly. The other 90% I expect to fail.” Those are the words of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates., As Foroohar sees it, the Libra “threatens to take us in the wrong direction, at exactly the wrong time.” Ok, but if it does then it will surely vanish as a measure of value for it taking us in the wrong direction. Foroohar is against the Libra given her expressed view that it will fail, but then every innovation the world has ever known (from the tractor to the airplane to the Apple iPhone) was met with the nose-turned-up superciliousness of the kind that Foroohar is directing at the Libra. Missed by Foroohar is that innovation is all about failure. Maybe the Libra won’t work, but even if so, currencies and commerce will be more attractively situated for better future effectiveness thanks to Facebook’s efforts to meet the needs of people now., That the people who make up any economy don’t trust government money is hardly a new, libertarian-ish thing. Going back many, many centuries to China’s Song dynasty, the Confucians at the time supported private money over what government would issue because \"the market would compel private issuers of money to maintain its value.\" Remember, no one ever trades money. Though “money” is exchanged with blinding regularity, the latter is an expression of a desire to move actual goods and services. The problem has long been that floating, unstable money forms issued by governments have corrupted what is always and everywhere about products for products. It’s created winners and losers despite trade logically being about each side of a transaction having been improved after the fact., Floating money values have been the cause of trade not enhancing one or both parties, and the reason is basic: so long as money fluctuates in terms of value, those who take money in return for tangible goods and services will sometimes get less than they brought to market in return. \\xa0Libra is a market response to money that no longer lives up to its singular purpose as a measure that facilitates the exchange of products for other products of roughly equal value., The good news is that in her response to what will improve the trade that is the basis of all economic activity, Foroohar didn’t lay a glove on Facebook. If we ignore her embarrassing dismissal of “cross-border financial flows,” Foroohar was reduced to worrying that crime would increase if governments were replaced by private issuers of money. Please. Let’s try to be serious. Those in the large – and growing - gambling and drug spaces could and would easily dismiss what some PR person relayed to Foroohar., Back to reality, a stable Libra represents opportunity for billions of workers around the world who’ve periodically suffered the capricious ways of monetary authorities on the way to the evisceration of their work. Basically Facebook can’t err in the way that governments have, and still remain in business. Thank goodness for the Libra. Foroohar might agree had she not grown up in the U.S., and as such, had she not always been able to earn dollars that, despite their own periodic instability, have always been exchangeable for goods and services around the world., I\\'m a speech and op-ed writer, Director of the Center for Economic Freedom at FreedomWorks, editor of RealClearMarkets, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Researc...]', '[Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (Photo by Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images), Teaching Innovation at IE Business School since 1990, and now, hacking education as Senior Advisor for Digital Transformation at IE University.

He is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand and looking away. Gambling addiction. Sincere emotions and entertainment concept., This is a big step forward for data science. It shows where the world is headed., Collecting and understanding data is key., There have been big strides in programs mastering board games like checkers and chess. A super AI called AlphaGo, a prototype from Google Mind, even conquered Go, an extremely complex Chinese strategy game. It trounced Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world, in a widely publicized match., Many software developers assumed Go was unassailable given the state of AI development., But AlphaGo caught Sedol off-guard. Developed by playing against itself millions of times, the software learned to be unpredictable. In the end, Sedol couldn’t determine why moves were being made., Pluribus, the Facebook and CMU collaboration, leans hard on being unpredictable.\\xa0It makes sense., Whereas checkers, chess and even Go are limited to two players, poker traditionally involves more, creating a significant challenge for an AI. Exploiting the weaknesses of a single player would not be enough. Pluribus was designed to take on five world-class opponents simultaneously., With six players, six hands of cards, the bets, and the sheer multitude of possible outcomes, the game would have overwhelmed even the most robust supercomputer. Pluribus needed a reliable edge., The edge researchers used was counterfactual regret minimization., The big idea: During training, as Pluribus played against itself, the AI noted the outcome of games given all of the variables. Then, the software systematically played game after game, altering a variable each time., Pluribus learned that some moves, even crazy ones, were winners in defined circumstances. Flummoxed players, for example, would fold. And that is the key., We humans fidget nervously; we behave predictably when we are anxious. Professional poker players can spot these tells a mile away. Pluribus does not really play to its opponents’ weaknesses. It plays to its inherent strength — it has no tell. It is completely unpredictable., The proof is in the gameplay., Researchers set Pluribus up against world-class professional poker players, including Jimmy Chou, Seth Daniels, Michael Gagliano, Sean Ruane and Jacob Toole. In 10,000 hands of Texas Hold ‘Em with five other players, Pluribus won chips consistently, along with high praise from its human competitors., Ruane even marveled at its relentless consistency., Public cloud infrastructure is democratizing computer processing and data storage. And Software-as-a-Service companies are building bolt-on applications to turn mountains of corporate data into actionable insights., It was a bold pitch, but Stoecker was on to something bigger — digital transformation., Sales in the first quarter, which ended March 31, were $76 million, a 51% increase year over year. Gross profits were $68 million, and cash flow was $16 million.

This is ironic because the whole thing about crypto is security and the safety it brings to things, especially information., However, crypto has been beset on all sides by scammers. Whether it is disappearing exchanges, scam initial coin offerings, robbers, hackers, fake investment schemes or goings on in the dark web, crypto has a massive crime problem., Where there are resources there are predators, so this should not be a surprise., Facebook’s Libra project recently being dragged to congress for hearings to explain itself is causing a stir even while it now seems that it will be some time before it goes live. A global private sector currency with a vast captive audience has made quite a few government money folks’ eyes bug out. Libra is a monetary ‘Mars attack.’ It is also an inevitable one, bound to be followed by many large organizations in search of printing their own money., The flip side of the criminal onslaught is the huge interest that bitcoin and other cryptos garner in the general populations. You can’t be interviewed as a public figure without someone popping a bitcoin question at you. It’s as if every financial and political figure was asked about the future and stock price of Netflix, a company with a similar market cap to bitcoin. This interest is not going away and will be a driver for the whole industry in the same way that bottom up interest in being online drove the take up of the internet and WWW., So it is not surprising that this week finds the first flush of libra crypto scammers moving in to steal money from the unwary., At least one criminal outfit has advertised access to libra on Facebook this week inviting \"expressions of interest in libra.\" Anyone who registered for that would then get hit up by a boiler room., The curious user reported the following:, “Today I get a call from a boiler room saying they are Facebook in Switzerland and wanting me to set up an account so I can trade. Apparently, I don’t need to worry if I have not done it before; a broker could do it for me.

The Libra scams have begun and there will be a world more of them coming our way., The question I really want answered is, how on earth did this outfit get to advertise on Facebook? Having been pummeled for a $5 billion fine for not keeping its users safe, here is a blatant example of Facebook putting its users at risk, by enabling a shady, unregulated and likely criminal organization to prey on its users., It’s unlikely that this crypto ad showed up on this user’s Facebook without there being a filter for him being a trader, crypto enthusiast or investor. Even if Facebook didn’t specifically target him for this outfit, how could it even get onto the platform at all?, If Facebook is going to launch Libra, it needs to care about these things and start locking out the obvious predators from its estate.

(AP, The chairman of a prominent House committee is asking for answers about secret Facebook groups that aired racist and sexist comments made by agents of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency., In a letter to a top official at the agency, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who heads the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote that his panel is \"investigating racist, sexist and xenophobic comments relating to immigrants and members of Congress made by employees of the Customs and Border Protection in \\'secret\\' Facebook groups.\", \"The committee is concerned that Border Patrol agents and other CBP employees who wrote posts disparaging immigrants may still be working with immigrants and children,\" Cummings wrote., In testimony to the committee earlier this month, acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan described the posts as \"unacceptable,\" and said that CBP\\'s Office of Professional Responsibility had launched an investigation., McAleenan told the committee that the agency had placed several employees on administrative duty, but could not name any of the specific positions who had been reassigned owing to the investigation., Cummings is suspicious. In his letter, he asks for information in a number of areas about the groups and the internal investigation, and notes that the CBP did not honor his request for a briefing on the matter., Spokesmen for the CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment., In a statement, a Facebook spokesman said the company has \"been in regular contact with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee and will continue to work with the committee to lawfully obtain the information it is seeking.\", \"We are also continuing to cooperate with federal authorities,\" the spokesman added., ProPublica noted that the CBP posts, made in secret Facebook groups known as \"I\\'m 10-15\" and \"The Real CBP Nation\" come as \"the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces.\", Cummings has issued an expansive data request to CBP, calling for the agency to turn over every piece of content from the secret Facebook groups dating to Jan. 20, 2017, along with identifying information about the thousands of current and former CBP employees who were members of the groups., He is also seeking the name, position and employment status of every employee who is under investigation., Cummings further asks the CBP to comply with his request for a briefing on the matter by Aug. 7, 2019., Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...]', '[An early research kit of a wearable brain-computer interface device, built by Facebook Reality Labs., Facebook says it\\'s getting closer to eliminating one of the tech world\\'s biggest problems: namely how ridiculously long it\\'s taken me to type this sentence., Ok, so it only took me about 30 seconds, but the words formed in my head in a fraction of that time. This problem of human latency is a key hurdle for tech giants like Google and Facebook that are looking for new ways to grow by shoving ever-more petabytes of data into our brains, and vice versa. , As part of their effort, Facebook has been funding a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) working to help patients with neurological damage to speak again by detecting imagined speech in real time. , \\xa0Facebook hopes the work of the UCSF team will serve as a proof of concept to inform the development of the non-invasive wearable it dreams of pairing with AR glasses., \\xa0\"If we can now measure signals in the brain via implantable devices, then we can transmit those signals outside of the brain.\", Facebook thinks that a promising way to make the leap from \"reading minds\" via wired electrodes to a wireless system is by measuring changes in oxygen levels in the brain using infrared light similar to a pulse oximeter at a doctor\\'s office. , \"This could work, though I am afraid that the rates (timing) of oxygenation processes are much lower than the actual rate at which speech is produced,\" Josep Jornet, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, told me. \"Certainly more work is needed, but this is what research is about and should be promoted.\", Todd Richmond, an IEEE member and Director of the Tech and Narrative Lab at the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica says \"having a viable capability in the lab\" to wirelessly send brain signals to a computer could be less than five years away., \\xa0\"It will likely take longer to move from the lab to commercial deployment for a variety of reasons,\" he adds., Richmond thinks the first hurdles will be solving technical problems to make the system lighter, smaller, faster and essentially, more practical. Next comes the process of refining the user experience to make brain interfaces a necessity rather than a novelty. , \\xa0\"The third set of developments will be around improving accuracy, efficacy, and safety,\" he explains. \"Like any consumer product, we’ll need to sort out what agencies are looking at what aspects of how devices impact humans, both individually and from a societal level.\", I\\'ve covered science, technology, the environment and politics for outlets including CNET, PC World, BYTE, Wired, AOL and NPR.

It also agrees to produce quarterly compliance reports and add an independent board committee to oversee its privacy practices., But that doesn\\'t go nearly far enough, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy counsel at the digital rights group Public Knowledge., \"Under this settlement, Facebook does not have to meaningfully change how it collects and uses your data. Facebook retains complete control over when to share your data outside of Facebook, as long as the company complies with the privacy policy that it gets to write,\" Slaiman said., The agreement does nothing to address the competitive advantages that Facebook enjoys by virtue of its size and reach, and could even insulate the company from further enforcement actions, she argues., \"While the settlement does require additional auditing processes and reporting requirements as well as a very large fine, the settlement is weak given the repeated violations and the severity of the harm,\" Slaiman said. \"We must pass new and more effective privacy laws, as well as broader platform regulation aimed at improving competition in the sector so that consumers can more easily switch to an alternative product if they are not happy.\", Not all of the criticisms of the settlement came from consumer advocates who wanted the company to face tougher penalties., At TechFreedom, a think tank with a libertarian bent, president Berin Szoka observed that $5 billion is no small penalty, even for Facebook, but while the company can rather easily afford it, \"who else could?\", \"Nothing could do more to discourage competition with today\\'s tech giants than the looming threat of such massive fines,\" Szoka said. \"Those cheering today\\'s settlement as a victory against Big Tech should think twice about its long-term effects on those trying to dethrone Facebook.\", Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...]', \"[Most tech companies know about you when you visit their websites or use their apps.

The post has been updated to reflect its position., The encryption debate is typically framed around the concept of an impenetrable link connecting two services whose communications the government wishes to monitor. The reality, of course, is that the security of that encryption link is entirely separate from the security of the devices it connects. The ability of encryption to shield a user’s communications rests upon the assumption that the sender and recipient’s devices are themselves secure, with the encrypted channel the only weak point., After all, if either user’s device is compromised, unbreakable encryption is of little relevance., This is why surveillance operations typically focus on compromising end devices, bypassing the encryption debate entirely. If a user’s cleartext keystrokes and screen captures can be streamed off their device in real-time, it matters little that they are eventually encrypted for transmission elsewhere., Historically, compromising end devices was an expensive and complex process, powered by a cat-and-mouse game with hardware manufacturers and software vendors to find vulnerabilities that could be used to remotely install them and acquire the necessary device privileges., Such efforts are hard to scale and the more devices that are compromised, the more likely the vulnerability is to be discovered and patched., In Facebook’s vision, the actual end-to-end encryption client itself such as WhatsApp will include embedded content moderation and blacklist filtering algorithms. These algorithms will be continually updated from a central cloud service, but will run locally on the user’s device, scanning each cleartext message before it is sent and each encrypted message after it is decrypted., Facebook’s model entirely bypasses the encryption debate by globalizing the current practice of compromising devices by building those encryption bypasses directly into the communications clients themselves and deploying what amounts to machine-based wiretaps to billions of users at once., Asked the current status of this work and when it might be deployed in the production version of WhatsApp, a company spokesperson declined to comment., Of course, Facebook’s efforts apply only to its own encryption clients, leaving criminals and terrorists to turn to other clients like Signal or their own bespoke clients they control the source code of., [UPDATE: 6:30PM EST 8/2/2019]:\\xa0Facebook disagrees that the F8 video on using artificial intelligence to keep content safe indicates it is planning to surveil users’ information. In Facebook’s words, \"We haven\\'t added a backdoor to WhatsApp,\" said WhatsApp vice president Will Cathcart in a post on HackerNews. \"To be crystal clear, we have not done this, have zero plans to do so, and if we ever did it would be quite obvious and detectable that we had done it. We understand the serious concerns this type of approach would raise which is why we are opposed to it,\" Cathcart wrote., The problem is that if Facebook’s model succeeds, it will only be a matter of time before device manufacturers and mobile operating system developers embed similar tools directly into devices themselves, making them impossible to escape. Embedding content scanning tools directly into phones would make it possible to scan all apps, including ones like Signal, effectively ending the era of encrypted communications., Governments would soon use lawful court orders to require companies to build in custom filters of content they are concerned about and automatically notify them of violations, including sending a copy of the offending content., Rather than grappling with how to defeat encryption, governments will simply be able to harness social media companies to perform their mass surveillance for them, sending them real-time alerts and copies of the decrypted content., While some phone manufacturers could distinguish themselves by offering bespoke phones with custom operating systems that do not include such scanning, such devices are likely to be rare, used only by those who are willing to go to great lengths to escape government scrutiny and thus automatically drawing substantial attention to themselves. Over time, it is likely that many governments will simply pass laws banning the possession and use of such devices, much as many jurisdictions ban devices that help speeders escape traffic tickets., In the end, encryption’s days are numbered and the world has Facebook to thank., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...]', \"[SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 30: The Portal by Facebook is displayed during the F8 Facebook Developers conference on April 30, 2019 in San Jose, California. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered the opening keynote to the FB Developer conference, Set to launch this Fall, Catalina is equally unlikely to thrill consumers that are on the verge of recession but more so, who don't trust you. Facebook should be wary of spending so much time, money and effort building products that people don't want when the one you are famous for is on fire in multiple areas. What should Facebook do to build trust? Change your ways would be a smart play - even just a little. Facebook doesn't seem to want to as that may halt the money printing presses, the big blue app keeps working 24/7. , Facebook doesn't need to decide whether they want to be a force for good and have a product that they want people to use not feel they have to use. The actions of the company have shown the side they pick time and time again. Shareholders. Doing so makes Facebook a good business but not a good company. The issue ahead of Facebook becomes less if people will ever trust Facebook again, that ship has sailed unless they find a new business model. Instead, the issue will likely surround if Facebook kills or buys everything that rises up against it. Only here will the EU and FTC be of use in helping (read: force) Facebook to change its ways., Facebook needs people to buy back into it but without changing the MO of the company this isn't going to happen and eventually the head will eat the tail.

Lacking Musk\\'s charisma, he regularly outrages people when violating norms about selling peoples\\' Facebook activity to corporate and political interests. People keep getting their dopamine hits from the endless stream of likes on their Facebook posts and despite fines and threat of government interference, the company keeps on beating expectations when it reports quarterly results., If you must buy an individual stock — buy one that passes the System 2 test rather than the one that excites your System 1.

In the aftermath of the 2016 election, news relating to the new administration and its policies were a common refrain in the call for more safe spaces. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s social media platforms saturate those same vulnerable individuals with ceaseless political ads that are impossible to escape. Why don’t platforms like Facebook allow users to opt-out of political advertisements, creating digital safe spaces from content that triggers them?, In our ever more hyper-partisan world in which differing viewpoints and information that conflicts with one’s viewpoints and beliefs or which touches upon past traumatic experiences can lead to intense psychological trauma, so-called “safe spaces” have emerged in the academic and corporate world as a way to escape the traumas of the real world., Despite their growing popularity, these physical rooms have no counterpart in the digital world., Attempting to insulate oneself online from contrary viewpoints or information or from narratives that touch upon past traumatic experiences is next to impossible. By their very design social media platforms are constructed to flood their users with an endless stream of information that is algorithmically curated just for them, personalized to maximize their reaction. Given that outrage provokes a far more energetic (and thus monetizable) response than serenity, the more social media platforms learn about us, the more they surround us with an endless curated firehose of hate and horror that is personalized just for us., Broadcast platforms like Twitter make it difficult to escape such content, since anyone can reach anyone else, yet even closed social networks like Facebook, in which connections are reciprocal, pose a growing challenge through their advertising., On Facebook a user can carefully construct their social group to ensure it consists only of those who think and act exactly like themselves, creating a homogeneous echo chamber that entirely insulates them from the outside world., Unfortunately, this echo chamber cannot protect them from advertisements., Notably absent from this list are political advertisements. Political and issue advertisements frequently touch upon the rawest and most divisive societal fracture lines that are often what drive individuals to seek refuge within those physical safe spaces. An ad for a brand of soda or bath towels at the local supermarket are unlikely to trigger trauma in the average person. Political ads, by their very nature, are designed to prompt strong emotional responses along the fault lines that define the partisan world of politics., Getting away from these ads can be nearly impossible. Today’s ads are so hyper-targeted and run in such vast quantities that no amount of clicking “don’t show me this ad” can stop the deluge, especially around election time., A user who is triggered by any mention of a particular political candidate who is running for election in their district will find it effectively impossible to escape their barrage of campaign ads on Facebook. Every login will bring another stream of ads and the more that user attempts to avoid them, the more they are likely to see., Even using Facebook’s advertising settings to manually remove every conceivable advertising selector and request that their interests not be used to show them ads will still likely end up being saturated by campaign ads. They are simply impossible to escape in today’s digital-first campaigning., For a company like Facebook that has embraced the concept of safe spaces in the physical world, why does it not offer the digital equivalent on its platform, allowing its users to get away from political advertisements that cause them enormous emotional distress?, A company spokesperson confirmed the company’s commitment to safe spaces and noted that it offers meditation spaces and special rooms for its own employees as a form of “safe space” and that for employees that feel triggered at work, many are permitted to work from home to escape those triggers. The spokesperson also noted that the company has rolled out new policies this year governing its internal message boards and communications forums in an effort to make all employees comfortable., Yet when asked why the company does not extend the same courtesy to offer the digital equivalent of such safe spaces to its two billion users to escape from advertisements that cause them deep distress or trauma and may even trigger hospitalization, the spokesperson said the company did not have comment., Asked why the company does not at the very least allow users to request that political ads be displayed with a blurred overlay with a trigger warning that requires manually clicking to see the actual ad, the company again declined to comment., This raises the question of why the company apparently does not believe that “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings” are a useful or important tool in today’s world for its users, despite extending such protections to its own employees. After all, if Facebook believed safe spaces were so important, it would roll them out on its own site by allowing users to protect themselves from triggering advertising content. Once again, the company declined to comment., Asked whether the company believes it should be held legally, ethically or morally responsible if a user suffers emotional distress or hospitalization from encountering an advertisement that triggers them given that the company actively refuses to allow users to remove political advertisements from their Facebook experience, the company again declined to comment., Given that Facebook does actively screen advertisements to ensure that they comply with its terms of service, it is not a neutral platform. It has a set of content standards and actively enforces these through moderation. This raises the question of how it would respond to the criticism that if it is actively enforcing content standards on its platform, it has a moral responsibility to provide a safe space on its platform that protects users from allowable content that triggers them. Again, the company declined to comment., Of course, one could argue that the point of advertising is to allow users to be forcibly exposed to views and perspectives they might not otherwise consume. At the same time, there must be a balance between forcible exposure to unexpected content and forced exposure to unwanted content that causes immense distress., On possibility would be to allow users to select the specific issues, political parties and candidates they would like to hear from, isolating them from issues and candidates that trigger them. Asked whether the company would consider offering such options, the company again declined to comment., Putting this all together, despite endorsing the concept of safe spaces and providing them to its own employees, Facebook appears to have little interest in offering a digital equivalent to its two billion users that would allow them to shield themselves from the increasingly divisive political and issue ads that can cause them immense trauma and distress., The company’s refusal to comment on any of these issues reminds us that for all its public statements, it has little interest in meaningful change that would impact its bottom line., In the end, as long as political ads bring in revenue, it will be impossible to escape them., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...]']\n"

      "['(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle), Facebook announced a brand policy change. Instagram and WhatsApp will now be endorsed by the Facebook corporate brand. Previously, these two popular social media brands were left as stand-alone brands within the Facebook portfolio. The Facebook move is designed for consolidation and revenue-generating reasons. Over the years, Facebook has moved to bring Instagram and WhatsApp closer into the Facebook model with more opportunities for cross-selling ads. Under the rubric of letting people know what products and services Facebook offers, Mr. Zuckerberg chose “From Facebook” as the designation., Brand endorsement policies can create internal dissension. It is not uncommon for the management teams of acquired brands or new brands to not want to be associated with their parent brand. Lou Gerstner faced this problem when he became CEO of IBM in the 1990s. The ThinkPad team did not want the IBM logo on its laptops. Mr. Gerstner made it clear that ThinkPad was an IBM ThinkPad., According to those in the know, Facebook’s brand policy change appears to be dictated by Mark Zuckerberg. Recent reporting indicates that there are managers who think that this endorsement strategy is a mistake. These managers state that positive user perceptions of Instagram’s and WhatsApp’s images are in peril. Internal data indicate that when Instagram and WhatsApp users are told the brands are Facebook-owned, positive perceptions of Instagram and WhatsApp fall., Mr. Zuckerberg’s move is seen frequently in businesses with branded portfolios. Today, we see some firms moving from having a portfolio of individual brands, where each individual brand builds preference on its own, to a corporate branded portfolio, where individual brands share a common, provenance-based corporate-derived heritage. Yet, this is not without internal challenges. For example, Holiday Inn hotels are marketed as part of a broad portfolio of hotel brands from IHG: “Holiday Inn, an IHG hotel,” Crowne Plaza, an IHG hotel,” “Hotel Indigo, an IHG hotel,” and so on. However, Kimpton and Regent Hotels and Resorts, recent IHG acquisitions, resist being identified as part of the IHG portfolio., If any brand needs a jolt of respectability, it is Facebook. The problem lurking within the Facebook strategy change is that Facebook’s trustworthiness has been severely damaged and Mr. Zuckerberg has not moved to right the listing ship. It must be frustrating to know that Instagram and WhatsApp have more positive, trustworthy images than their Facebook parent brand. The bigger issue is whether Zuckerberg feels that Facebook association with Instagram and WhatsApp will provide a positive image to their parent brand, Facebook. This is not likely., Mr. Zuckerberg may be testing the limits of his power to have a massive parent brand with strong tentacles across a portfolio of brands by bringing Instagram and WhatsApp under the Facebook corporate banner. If Zuckerberg considers the endorsement strategy to be a pathway to rebuilding Facebook trust, counting on Instagram and WhatsApp to help repair Facebook’s disgraced image, this is a brand-business pipedream., My focus is building brands as the basis for enduring profitable business growth. I have won a variety of marketing awards.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik), Looked at through the prism of a question asked by Foroohar, and that she plainly didn’t understand, “easier cross-border financial flows” have been the sole purpose of capitalist production for as long as the world’s inhabitants have been able to specialize, and in the process exchange the fruits of their own labor for the fruits of others. For one to work is for one to express a powerful desire to import. The importing could be from across the street or from the other side of the world, but import it is. The “cross-border financial flows” that Foroohar so naively disdains are merely happy evidence of a world that grows more connected by the day., With its proposed introduction of the Libra, Facebook is thankfully aiming to enhance the ability of individuals to exchange with other individuals. Will it succeed? Who knows? Foroohar thinks not, so she dismisses the very notion of the Libra with misplaced and misinformed contempt. She misses the point. To see why, please read on., \"Technology is a boom or bust business, but it’s mostly busts. I’ve always assumed 10% of my technology investments will succeed – and succeed wildly. The other 90% I expect to fail.” Those are the words of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates., As Foroohar sees it, the Libra “threatens to take us in the wrong direction, at exactly the wrong time.” Ok, but if it does then it will surely vanish as a measure of value for it taking us in the wrong direction. Foroohar is against the Libra given her expressed view that it will fail, but then every innovation the world has ever known (from the tractor to the airplane to the Apple iPhone) was met with the nose-turned-up superciliousness of the kind that Foroohar is directing at the Libra. Missed by Foroohar is that innovation is all about failure. Maybe the Libra won’t work, but even if so, currencies and commerce will be more attractively situated for better future effectiveness thanks to Facebook’s efforts to meet the needs of people now., That the people who make up any economy don’t trust government money is hardly a new, libertarian-ish thing. Going back many, many centuries to China’s Song dynasty, the Confucians at the time supported private money over what government would issue because \"the market would compel private issuers of money to maintain its value.\" Remember, no one ever trades money. Though “money” is exchanged with blinding regularity, the latter is an expression of a desire to move actual goods and services. The problem has long been that floating, unstable money forms issued by governments have corrupted what is always and everywhere about products for products. It’s created winners and losers despite trade logically being about each side of a transaction having been improved after the fact., Floating money values have been the cause of trade not enhancing one or both parties, and the reason is basic: so long as money fluctuates in terms of value, those who take money in return for tangible goods and services will sometimes get less than they brought to market in return.  Libra is a market response to money that no longer lives up to its singular purpose as a measure that facilitates the exchange of products for other products of roughly equal value., The good news is that in her response to what will improve the trade that is the basis of all economic activity, Foroohar didn’t lay a glove on Facebook. If we ignore her embarrassing dismissal of “cross-border financial flows,” Foroohar was reduced to worrying that crime would increase if governments were replaced by private issuers of money. Please. Let’s try to be serious. Those in the large – and growing - gambling and drug spaces could and would easily dismiss what some PR person relayed to Foroohar., Back to reality, a stable Libra represents opportunity for billions of workers around the world who’ve periodically suffered the capricious ways of monetary authorities on the way to the evisceration of their work. Basically Facebook can’t err in the way that governments have, and still remain in business. Thank goodness for the Libra. Foroohar might agree had she not grown up in the U.S., and as such, had she not always been able to earn dollars that, despite their own periodic instability, have always been exchangeable for goods and services around the world., I\\'m a speech and op-ed writer, Director of the Center for Economic Freedom at FreedomWorks, editor of RealClearMarkets, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Researc...', 'Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (Photo by Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images), Teaching Innovation at IE Business School since 1990, and now, hacking education as Senior Advisor for Digital Transformation at IE University.

He is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand and looking away. Gambling addiction. Sincere emotions and entertainment concept., This is a big step forward for data science. It shows where the world is headed., Collecting and understanding data is key., There have been big strides in programs mastering board games like checkers and chess. A super AI called AlphaGo, a prototype from Google Mind, even conquered Go, an extremely complex Chinese strategy game. It trounced Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world, in a widely publicized match., Many software developers assumed Go was unassailable given the state of AI development., But AlphaGo caught Sedol off-guard. Developed by playing against itself millions of times, the software learned to be unpredictable. In the end, Sedol couldn’t determine why moves were being made., Pluribus, the Facebook and CMU collaboration, leans hard on being unpredictable. It makes sense., Whereas checkers, chess and even Go are limited to two players, poker traditionally involves more, creating a significant challenge for an AI. Exploiting the weaknesses of a single player would not be enough. Pluribus was designed to take on five world-class opponents simultaneously., With six players, six hands of cards, the bets, and the sheer multitude of possible outcomes, the game would have overwhelmed even the most robust supercomputer. Pluribus needed a reliable edge., The edge researchers used was counterfactual regret minimization., The big idea: During training, as Pluribus played against itself, the AI noted the outcome of games given all of the variables. Then, the software systematically played game after game, altering a variable each time., Pluribus learned that some moves, even crazy ones, were winners in defined circumstances. Flummoxed players, for example, would fold. And that is the key., We humans fidget nervously; we behave predictably when we are anxious. Professional poker players can spot these tells a mile away. Pluribus does not really play to its opponents’ weaknesses. It plays to its inherent strength — it has no tell. It is completely unpredictable., The proof is in the gameplay., Researchers set Pluribus up against world-class professional poker players, including Jimmy Chou, Seth Daniels, Michael Gagliano, Sean Ruane and Jacob Toole. In 10,000 hands of Texas Hold ‘Em with five other players, Pluribus won chips consistently, along with high praise from its human competitors., Ruane even marveled at its relentless consistency., Public cloud infrastructure is democratizing computer processing and data storage. And Software-as-a-Service companies are building bolt-on applications to turn mountains of corporate data into actionable insights., It was a bold pitch, but Stoecker was on to something bigger — digital transformation., Sales in the first quarter, which ended March 31, were $76 million, a 51% increase year over year. Gross profits were $68 million, and cash flow was $16 million. The company logged 2018 sales of $253 million, up 92.6% vs.  2017., The business is growing fast and that is being reflected in the share price. Alteryx shares are up 104% this year, and 209% during the past 12 months., Shares trade at 166x forward earnings and 26x sales.

This is ironic because the whole thing about crypto is security and the safety it brings to things, especially information., However, crypto has been beset on all sides by scammers. Whether it is disappearing exchanges, scam initial coin offerings, robbers, hackers, fake investment schemes or goings on in the dark web, crypto has a massive crime problem., Where there are resources there are predators, so this should not be a surprise., Facebook’s Libra project recently being dragged to congress for hearings to explain itself is causing a stir even while it now seems that it will be some time before it goes live. A global private sector currency with a vast captive audience has made quite a few government money folks’ eyes bug out. Libra is a monetary ‘Mars attack.’ It is also an inevitable one, bound to be followed by many large organizations in search of printing their own money., The flip side of the criminal onslaught is the huge interest that bitcoin and other cryptos garner in the general populations. You can’t be interviewed as a public figure without someone popping a bitcoin question at you. It’s as if every financial and political figure was asked about the future and stock price of Netflix, a company with a similar market cap to bitcoin. This interest is not going away and will be a driver for the whole industry in the same way that bottom up interest in being online drove the take up of the internet and WWW., So it is not surprising that this week finds the first flush of libra crypto scammers moving in to steal money from the unwary., At least one criminal outfit has advertised access to libra on Facebook this week inviting \"expressions of interest in libra.\" Anyone who registered for that would then get hit up by a boiler room., The curious user reported the following:, “Today I get a call from a boiler room saying they are Facebook in Switzerland and wanting me to set up an account so I can trade. Apparently, I don’t need to worry if I have not done it before; a broker could do it for me. They were going to give $300 to start with to trade implying this was $300 of libra.”, This is all reminiscent of the criminals who worked in \"binary bets\" a simple bilk where if the vicious gambling product didn’t get you, then the company would by simply not paying your money back, which was vastly more likely to be what you had left after losses than winnings. This was a very lucrative racket for some very shady people creating such a pestilence that the EU and many other jurisdictions shut down the basis of the swindle, the trading of binary bets. , If you see anything like this in future, simply ignore it. The Libra scams have begun and there will be a world more of them coming our way., The question I really want answered is, how on earth did this outfit get to advertise on Facebook? Having been pummeled for a $5 billion fine for not keeping its users safe, here is a blatant example of Facebook putting its users at risk, by enabling a shady, unregulated and likely criminal organization to prey on its users., It’s unlikely that this crypto ad showed up on this user’s Facebook without there being a filter for him being a trader, crypto enthusiast or investor. Even if Facebook didn’t specifically target him for this outfit, how could it even get onto the platform at all?, If Facebook is going to launch Libra, it needs to care about these things and start locking out the obvious predators from its estate.

Elijah Cummings, D-Md., holds up his gavel as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan appears before a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, July 18, 2019. (AP, The chairman of a prominent House committee is asking for answers about secret Facebook groups that aired racist and sexist comments made by agents of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency., In a letter to a top official at the agency, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who heads the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote that his panel is \"investigating racist, sexist and xenophobic comments relating to immigrants and members of Congress made by employees of the Customs and Border Protection in \\'secret\\' Facebook groups.\", \"The committee is concerned that Border Patrol agents and other CBP employees who wrote posts disparaging immigrants may still be working with immigrants and children,\" Cummings wrote., In testimony to the committee earlier this month, acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan described the posts as \"unacceptable,\" and said that CBP\\'s Office of Professional Responsibility had launched an investigation., McAleenan told the committee that the agency had placed several employees on administrative duty, but could not name any of the specific positions who had been reassigned owing to the investigation., Cummings is suspicious. In his letter, he asks for information in a number of areas about the groups and the internal investigation, and notes that the CBP did not honor his request for a briefing on the matter., Spokesmen for the CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment., In a statement, a Facebook spokesman said the company has \"been in regular contact with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee and will continue to work with the committee to lawfully obtain the information it is seeking.\", \"We are also continuing to cooperate with federal authorities,\" the spokesman added., ProPublica noted that the CBP posts, made in secret Facebook groups known as \"I\\'m 10-15\" and \"The Real CBP Nation\" come as \"the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces.\", Cummings has issued an expansive data request to CBP, calling for the agency to turn over every piece of content from the secret Facebook groups dating to Jan. 20, 2017, along with identifying information about the thousands of current and former CBP employees who were members of the groups., He is also seeking the name, position and employment status of every employee who is under investigation., Cummings further asks the CBP to comply with his request for a briefing on the matter by Aug. 7, 2019., Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...', 'An early research kit of a wearable brain-computer interface device, built by Facebook Reality Labs., Facebook says it\\'s getting closer to eliminating one of the tech world\\'s biggest problems: namely how ridiculously long it\\'s taken me to type this sentence., Ok, so it only took me about 30 seconds, but the words formed in my head in a fraction of that time. This problem of human latency is a key hurdle for tech giants like Google and Facebook that are looking for new ways to grow by shoving ever-more petabytes of data into our brains, and vice versa. , As part of their effort, Facebook has been funding a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) working to help patients with neurological damage to speak again by detecting imagined speech in real time. ,  Facebook hopes the work of the UCSF team will serve as a proof of concept to inform the development of the non-invasive wearable it dreams of pairing with AR glasses.,  \"If we can now measure signals in the brain via implantable devices, then we can transmit those signals outside of the brain.\", Facebook thinks that a promising way to make the leap from \"reading minds\" via wired electrodes to a wireless system is by measuring changes in oxygen levels in the brain using infrared light similar to a pulse oximeter at a doctor\\'s office. , \"This could work, though I am afraid that the rates (timing) of oxygenation processes are much lower than the actual rate at which speech is produced,\" Josep Jornet, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, told me. \"Certainly more work is needed, but this is what research is about and should be promoted.\", Todd Richmond, an IEEE member and Director of the Tech and Narrative Lab at the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica says \"having a viable capability in the lab\" to wirelessly send brain signals to a computer could be less than five years away.,  \"It will likely take longer to move from the lab to commercial deployment for a variety of reasons,\" he adds., Richmond thinks the first hurdles will be solving technical problems to make the system lighter, smaller, faster and essentially, more practical. Next comes the process of refining the user experience to make brain interfaces a necessity rather than a novelty. ,  \"The third set of developments will be around improving accuracy, efficacy, and safety,\" he explains. \"Like any consumer product, we’ll need to sort out what agencies are looking at what aspects of how devices impact humans, both individually and from a societal level.\", I\\'ve covered science, technology, the environment and politics for outlets including CNET, PC World, BYTE, Wired, AOL and NPR.

It also agrees to produce quarterly compliance reports and add an independent board committee to oversee its privacy practices., But that doesn\\'t go nearly far enough, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy counsel at the digital rights group Public Knowledge., \"Under this settlement, Facebook does not have to meaningfully change how it collects and uses your data. Facebook retains complete control over when to share your data outside of Facebook, as long as the company complies with the privacy policy that it gets to write,\" Slaiman said., The agreement does nothing to address the competitive advantages that Facebook enjoys by virtue of its size and reach, and could even insulate the company from further enforcement actions, she argues., \"While the settlement does require additional auditing processes and reporting requirements as well as a very large fine, the settlement is weak given the repeated violations and the severity of the harm,\" Slaiman said. \"We must pass new and more effective privacy laws, as well as broader platform regulation aimed at improving competition in the sector so that consumers can more easily switch to an alternative product if they are not happy.\", Not all of the criticisms of the settlement came from consumer advocates who wanted the company to face tougher penalties., At TechFreedom, a think tank with a libertarian bent, president Berin Szoka observed that $5 billion is no small penalty, even for Facebook, but while the company can rather easily afford it, \"who else could?\", \"Nothing could do more to discourage competition with today\\'s tech giants than the looming threat of such massive fines,\" Szoka said. \"Those cheering today\\'s settlement as a victory against Big Tech should think twice about its long-term effects on those trying to dethrone Facebook.\", Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...', \"Most tech companies know about you when you visit their websites or use their apps.

The post has been updated to reflect its position., The encryption debate is typically framed around the concept of an impenetrable link connecting two services whose communications the government wishes to monitor. The reality, of course, is that the security of that encryption link is entirely separate from the security of the devices it connects. The ability of encryption to shield a user’s communications rests upon the assumption that the sender and recipient’s devices are themselves secure, with the encrypted channel the only weak point., After all, if either user’s device is compromised, unbreakable encryption is of little relevance., This is why surveillance operations typically focus on compromising end devices, bypassing the encryption debate entirely. If a user’s cleartext keystrokes and screen captures can be streamed off their device in real-time, it matters little that they are eventually encrypted for transmission elsewhere., Historically, compromising end devices was an expensive and complex process, powered by a cat-and-mouse game with hardware manufacturers and software vendors to find vulnerabilities that could be used to remotely install them and acquire the necessary device privileges., Such efforts are hard to scale and the more devices that are compromised, the more likely the vulnerability is to be discovered and patched., In Facebook’s vision, the actual end-to-end encryption client itself such as WhatsApp will include embedded content moderation and blacklist filtering algorithms. These algorithms will be continually updated from a central cloud service, but will run locally on the user’s device, scanning each cleartext message before it is sent and each encrypted message after it is decrypted., Facebook’s model entirely bypasses the encryption debate by globalizing the current practice of compromising devices by building those encryption bypasses directly into the communications clients themselves and deploying what amounts to machine-based wiretaps to billions of users at once., Asked the current status of this work and when it might be deployed in the production version of WhatsApp, a company spokesperson declined to comment., Of course, Facebook’s efforts apply only to its own encryption clients, leaving criminals and terrorists to turn to other clients like Signal or their own bespoke clients they control the source code of., UPDATE: 6:30PM EST 8/2/2019: Facebook disagrees that the F8 video on using artificial intelligence to keep content safe indicates it is planning to surveil users’ information. In Facebook’s words, \"We haven\\'t added a backdoor to WhatsApp,\" said WhatsApp vice president Will Cathcart in a post on HackerNews. \"To be crystal clear, we have not done this, have zero plans to do so, and if we ever did it would be quite obvious and detectable that we had done it. We understand the serious concerns this type of approach would raise which is why we are opposed to it,\" Cathcart wrote., The problem is that if Facebook’s model succeeds, it will only be a matter of time before device manufacturers and mobile operating system developers embed similar tools directly into devices themselves, making them impossible to escape. Embedding content scanning tools directly into phones would make it possible to scan all apps, including ones like Signal, effectively ending the era of encrypted communications., Governments would soon use lawful court orders to require companies to build in custom filters of content they are concerned about and automatically notify them of violations, including sending a copy of the offending content., Rather than grappling with how to defeat encryption, governments will simply be able to harness social media companies to perform their mass surveillance for them, sending them real-time alerts and copies of the decrypted content., While some phone manufacturers could distinguish themselves by offering bespoke phones with custom operating systems that do not include such scanning, such devices are likely to be rare, used only by those who are willing to go to great lengths to escape government scrutiny and thus automatically drawing substantial attention to themselves. Over time, it is likely that many governments will simply pass laws banning the possession and use of such devices, much as many jurisdictions ban devices that help speeders escape traffic tickets., In the end, encryption’s days are numbered and the world has Facebook to thank., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...', \"SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 30: The Portal by Facebook is displayed during the F8 Facebook Developers conference on April 30, 2019 in San Jose, California.

Facebook should be wary of spending so much time, money and effort building products that people don't want when the one you are famous for is on fire in multiple areas. What should Facebook do to build trust? Change your ways would be a smart play - even just a little. Facebook doesn't seem to want to as that may halt the money printing presses, the big blue app keeps working 24/7. , Facebook doesn't need to decide whether they want to be a force for good and have a product that they want people to use not feel they have to use. The actions of the company have shown the side they pick time and time again. Shareholders. Doing so makes Facebook a good business but not a good company. The issue ahead of Facebook becomes less if people will ever trust Facebook again, that ship has sailed unless they find a new business model. Instead, the issue will likely surround if Facebook kills or buys everything that rises up against it. Only here will the EU and FTC be of use in helping (read: force) Facebook to change its ways., Facebook needs people to buy back into it but without changing the MO of the company this isn't going to happen and eventually the head will eat the tail.

Lacking Musk\\'s charisma, he regularly outrages people when violating norms about selling peoples\\' Facebook activity to corporate and political interests. People keep getting their dopamine hits from the endless stream of likes on their Facebook posts and despite fines and threat of government interference, the company keeps on beating expectations when it reports quarterly results., If you must buy an individual stock — buy one that passes the System 2 test rather than the one that excites your System 1.

In the aftermath of the 2016 election, news relating to the new administration and its policies were a common refrain in the call for more safe spaces. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s social media platforms saturate those same vulnerable individuals with ceaseless political ads that are impossible to escape. Why don’t platforms like Facebook allow users to opt-out of political advertisements, creating digital safe spaces from content that triggers them?, In our ever more hyper-partisan world in which differing viewpoints and information that conflicts with one’s viewpoints and beliefs or which touches upon past traumatic experiences can lead to intense psychological trauma, so-called “safe spaces” have emerged in the academic and corporate world as a way to escape the traumas of the real world., Despite their growing popularity, these physical rooms have no counterpart in the digital world., Attempting to insulate oneself online from contrary viewpoints or information or from narratives that touch upon past traumatic experiences is next to impossible. By their very design social media platforms are constructed to flood their users with an endless stream of information that is algorithmically curated just for them, personalized to maximize their reaction. Given that outrage provokes a far more energetic (and thus monetizable) response than serenity, the more social media platforms learn about us, the more they surround us with an endless curated firehose of hate and horror that is personalized just for us., Broadcast platforms like Twitter make it difficult to escape such content, since anyone can reach anyone else, yet even closed social networks like Facebook, in which connections are reciprocal, pose a growing challenge through their advertising., On Facebook a user can carefully construct their social group to ensure it consists only of those who think and act exactly like themselves, creating a homogeneous echo chamber that entirely insulates them from the outside world., Unfortunately, this echo chamber cannot protect them from advertisements., Notably absent from this list are political advertisements. Political and issue advertisements frequently touch upon the rawest and most divisive societal fracture lines that are often what drive individuals to seek refuge within those physical safe spaces. An ad for a brand of soda or bath towels at the local supermarket are unlikely to trigger trauma in the average person. Political ads, by their very nature, are designed to prompt strong emotional responses along the fault lines that define the partisan world of politics., Getting away from these ads can be nearly impossible. Today’s ads are so hyper-targeted and run in such vast quantities that no amount of clicking “don’t show me this ad” can stop the deluge, especially around election time., A user who is triggered by any mention of a particular political candidate who is running for election in their district will find it effectively impossible to escape their barrage of campaign ads on Facebook. Every login will bring another stream of ads and the more that user attempts to avoid them, the more they are likely to see., Even using Facebook’s advertising settings to manually remove every conceivable advertising selector and request that their interests not be used to show them ads will still likely end up being saturated by campaign ads. They are simply impossible to escape in today’s digital-first campaigning., For a company like Facebook that has embraced the concept of safe spaces in the physical world, why does it not offer the digital equivalent on its platform, allowing its users to get away from political advertisements that cause them enormous emotional distress?, A company spokesperson confirmed the company’s commitment to safe spaces and noted that it offers meditation spaces and special rooms for its own employees as a form of “safe space” and that for employees that feel triggered at work, many are permitted to work from home to escape those triggers. The spokesperson also noted that the company has rolled out new policies this year governing its internal message boards and communications forums in an effort to make all employees comfortable., Yet when asked why the company does not extend the same courtesy to offer the digital equivalent of such safe spaces to its two billion users to escape from advertisements that cause them deep distress or trauma and may even trigger hospitalization, the spokesperson said the company did not have comment., Asked why the company does not at the very least allow users to request that political ads be displayed with a blurred overlay with a trigger warning that requires manually clicking to see the actual ad, the company again declined to comment., This raises the question of why the company apparently does not believe that “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings” are a useful or important tool in today’s world for its users, despite extending such protections to its own employees. After all, if Facebook believed safe spaces were so important, it would roll them out on its own site by allowing users to protect themselves from triggering advertising content. Once again, the company declined to comment., Asked whether the company believes it should be held legally, ethically or morally responsible if a user suffers emotional distress or hospitalization from encountering an advertisement that triggers them given that the company actively refuses to allow users to remove political advertisements from their Facebook experience, the company again declined to comment., Given that Facebook does actively screen advertisements to ensure that they comply with its terms of service, it is not a neutral platform. It has a set of content standards and actively enforces these through moderation. This raises the question of how it would respond to the criticism that if it is actively enforcing content standards on its platform, it has a moral responsibility to provide a safe space on its platform that protects users from allowable content that triggers them. Again, the company declined to comment., Of course, one could argue that the point of advertising is to allow users to be forcibly exposed to views and perspectives they might not otherwise consume. At the same time, there must be a balance between forcible exposure to unexpected content and forced exposure to unwanted content that causes immense distress., On possibility would be to allow users to select the specific issues, political parties and candidates they would like to hear from, isolating them from issues and candidates that trigger them. Asked whether the company would consider offering such options, the company again declined to comment., Putting this all together, despite endorsing the concept of safe spaces and providing them to its own employees, Facebook appears to have little interest in offering a digital equivalent to its two billion users that would allow them to shield themselves from the increasingly divisive political and issue ads that can cause them immense trauma and distress., The company’s refusal to comment on any of these issues reminds us that for all its public statements, it has little interest in meaningful change that would impact its bottom line., In the end, as long as political ads bring in revenue, it will be impossible to escape them., Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...']\n"
